<h1>Nondiscrimination Policy</h1>

<p>Last Updated: September 8, 2017</p>

<strong>Our Commitment to Inclusion and Respect</strong>

<p>The FairlyWed community is committed to building a world where people from every background feel respected. This commitment
    rests on two foundational principles that apply both to FairlyWed’s clients and vendors: <strong>inclusion and respect</strong>.
    Our shared commitment to these principles enables every member of our community to feel welcome on the FairlyWed platform
    no matter who they are, where they come from, how they worship, or whom they love. FairlyWed recognizes that some jurisdictions
    permit, or require, distinctions among individuals based on factors such as national origin, gender, marital status or
    sexual orientation, and it does not require vendors to violate local laws or take actions that may subject them to legal
    liability. FairlyWed will provide additional guidance and adjust this nondiscrimination policy to reflect such permissions
    and requirements in the jurisdictions where they exist.</p>

<p>We are all committed to doing everything we can to help eliminate all forms of unlawful bias, discrimination, and intolerance
    from our platform. We want to promote a culture within the FairlyWed community—vendors, clients, and people considering
    whether to use our platform—that goes above and beyond mere compliance.</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Inclusion &ndash;</strong> We serve clients of all backgrounds with open minds. Joining FairlyWed, as a vendor
        or client, means becoming part of a community of inclusion. Bias, prejudice, racism, and hatred have no place on
        our platform or in our community. While vendors are required to follow all applicable laws that prohibit discrimination
        based on such factors as race, religion, national origin, and others listed below, we commit to do more than comply
        with the minimum requirements established by law.</li>
    <li><strong>Respect</strong> <strong>&ndash;</strong> We are respectful of each other in our interactions and encounters.
        FairlyWed appreciates that local laws and cultural norms vary around the world and expects vendors and clients to
        abide by local laws, and to engage with each other respectfully, even when views may not reflect their beliefs or
        upbringings. FairlyWed&rsquo;s members bring to our community an incredible diversity of background experiences,
        beliefs, and customs. By connecting people from different backgrounds, FairlyWed fosters greater understanding and
        appreciation for the common characteristics shared by all human beings and undermines prejudice rooted in misconception,
        misinformation, or misunderstanding.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Specific Guidance for Vendors in the United States and European Union</strong></p>

<p>As a general matter, we will familiarize ourselves with all applicable federal, state, and local laws that apply to wedding services. 
    Vendors should contact FairlyWed customer service if they have any questions about
    their obligations to comply with this FairlyWed Nondiscrimination Policy. FairlyWed will release further discrimination
    policy guidance for jurisdictions outside the United States in the near future. Guided by these principles, our U.S.
    and EU vendor community will follow these rules when considering potential clients and vendoring clients:</p>

<p>
    <u><strong>Race, Color, Ethnicity, National Origin, Religion, Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity, or Marital Status</strong></u>
</p>

<ul>
    <li>FairlyWed vendors
        <u><strong>may not</strong></u>
        <ul>
            <li>Decline a client based on race, color, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity,
                or marital status.</li>
            <li>Impose any different terms or conditions based on race, color, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation,
                gender identity, or marital status.</li>
            <li>Post any listing or make any statement that discourages or indicates a preference for or against any client on
                account of race, color, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, or marital
                status.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    <u><strong>Gender</strong></u>
</p>

<ul>
    <li>FairlyWed vendors
        <u><strong>may not</strong></u>
        <ul>
            <li>Decline to serve a client based on gender or sexual orientation.</li>
            <li>Post any listing or make any statement that discourages or indicates a preference for or against any client on
                account of gender or sexual orientation.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    <u><strong>Disability</strong></u>
</p>

<ul>
    <li>FairlyWed vendors
        <u><strong>may not</strong></u>:
        <ul>
            <li>Decline a client based on any actual or perceived disability.</li>
            <li>Impose any different terms or conditions based on the fact that the client has a disability.</li>
            <li>Substitute their own judgment about whether a service meets the needs of a client with a disability for that of
                the prospective client.</li>
            <li>Inquire about the existence or severity of a client&rsquo;s disability, or the means used to accommodate any
                disability. If, however, a potential client raises his or her disability, a vendor may, and should, discuss
                with the potential client whether the listing meets the potential client&rsquo;s needs.</li>
            <li>Prohibit or limit the use of mobility devices.</li>
            <li>Charge more for services or other fees for clients with disabilities.</li>
            <li>Post any listing or make any statement that discourages or indicates a preference for or against any client on
                account of the fact that the client has a disability.</li>
            <li>Refuse to communicate with clients through accessible means that are available, including relay operators (for
                people with hearing impairments) and e-mail (for people with vision impairments using screen readers).</li>
            <li>Refuse to provide reasonable accommodations, including flexibility when clients with disabilities request modest
                changes. When a client requests such an accommodation, the vendor
                and the client should engage in a dialogue to explore mutually agreeable ways to ensure the unit meets the
                client&rsquo;s needs.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>FairlyWed venue vendors
        <u><strong>may</strong></u>:
        <ul>
            <li>Provide factually accurate information about the venue&rsquo;s accessibility features (or lack of them), allowing
                for clients with disabilities to assess for themselves whether the venue is appropriate to their individual
                needs.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    <u><strong>Personal Preferences</strong></u>
</p>

<ul>
    <li>FairlyWed vendors
        <u><strong>may</strong></u>
        <ul>
            <li>Except as noted above, FairlyWed vendors may decline to serve based on factors that are not prohibited by law.
                For example, except where prohibited by law, FairlyWed photography vendor may decline to serve clients who
                request images be taken of a nudity.</li>
            <li>Require clients to respect restrictions on services offerred in the listing (e.g., a catering vendor who serves
                only Kosher or vegetarian food may require clients to respect those restrictions).</li>
            <li>Nothing in this policy prevents a vendor from turning down a client on the basis of a characteristic that is
                not protected under the civil rights laws or closely associated with a protected class. For example, a FairlyWed
                vendor may turn down a client who wants to have nude images taken.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>When clients are turned down.</strong> Vendors should keep in mind that no one likes to be turned down. While a vendor
    may have, and articulate, lawful and legitimate reasons for turning down a potential client, it may cause that member
    of our community to feel unwelcome or excluded. Vendors should make every effort to be welcoming to clients of all backgrounds.
    Vendors who demonstrate a pattern of rejecting clients from a protected class (even while articulating legitimate reasons),
    undermine the strength of our community by making potential clients feel unwelcome, and FairlyWed may suspend vendors
    who have demonstrated such a pattern from the FairlyWed platform.</p>

<p><strong>Specific Guidance for Vendors Outside the United States and European Union</strong></p>

<p>Outside of the United States and the European Union, some countries or communities may allow or even require people to make
    accommodation distinctions based on, for example, marital status, national origin, gender or sexual orientation, in violation
    of our general nondiscrimination philosophy. In these cases, we do not require vendors to violate local laws, nor to
    accept clients that could expose the vendors to a real and demonstrable risk of arrest, or physical harm to their persons
    or property. Vendors who live in such areas should set out any such restriction on their ability to serve particular clients
    in their listing, so that prospective clients are aware of the issue and FairlyWed can confirm the necessity for such
    an action. In communicating any such restrictions, we expect vendors to use clear, factual, non-derogatory terms. Slurs
    and insults have no place on our platform or in our community.</p>

<p><strong>What happens when a vendor does not comply with our policies in this area?</strong></p>

<p>If a particular listing contains language contrary to this nondiscrimination policy, the vendor will be asked to remove the
    language and affirm his or her understanding and intent to comply with this policy and its underlying principles. FairlyWed
    may also, in its discretion, take steps up to and including suspending the vendor from the FairlyWed platform.</p>

<p>If the vendor improperly rejects clients on the basis of protected class, or uses language demonstrating that his or her
    actions were motivated by factors prohibited by this policy, FairlyWed will take steps to enforce this policy, up to
    and including suspending the vendor from the platform.</p>

<p>As the FairlyWed community grows, we will continue to ensure that FairlyWed&rsquo;s policies and practices align with our
    most important goal: To ensure that clients and vendors feel welcome and respected in all of their interactions using
    the FairlyWed platform. The public, our community, and we ourselves, expect no less than this.</p>
