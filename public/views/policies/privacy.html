<h1>FairlyWed Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>Last Updated: September 10, 2017</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, process, and disclose your information across the FairlyWed Platform.</p>

<p>If you see an undefined term in this Privacy Policy (such as “Listing” or “FairlyWed Platform”), it has the same definition
  as outlined in our <a ui-sref="policies.terms">Terms of Service</a>.</p>

<p>When this policy mentions “FairlyWed,” “we,” “us,” or “our,” it refers to the FairlyWed company that is responsible for your
  information under this Privacy Policy (the “<strong>Data Controller</strong>”).</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you reside in the United States, the Data Controller is FairlyWed, Inc.</li>
  <li>If you reside outside of the United States and the People’s Republic of China (for purposes of this Privacy Policy, the
    People’s Republic of China does not include Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan) (“<strong>China</strong>”), the Data Controller
    is FairlyWed Ireland UC (“<strong>FairlyWed Ireland</strong>”).</li>
  <li>If you reside in China, the Data Controller is FairlyWed Internet (Beijing) Co., Ltd. (“<strong>FairlyWed China</strong>”),
    except where you book a Vendor Service or create a Listing located outside of China, in which case, the Data Controller
    is FairlyWed Ireland for that transaction. Additionally, FairlyWed Ireland will be the Data Controller for all bookings
    confirmed prior to December 7, 2016 at 10:00am UTC.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you change your place of residence, the Data Controller will be determined by your new place of residence as specified
  above, from the date on which your place of residence changes.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy also applies to the Payment Services provided to you by FairlyWed Payments pursuant to the <a href="/terms/payments_terms">Payments Terms of Service</a>  (“<strong>Payments Terms</strong>”). One or more FairlyWed Payments entities will be the Data Controller of your information
  related to the Payment Services depending on where your Payment Method or Payout Method is issued:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If issued in the United States, the Data Controller is FairlyWed Payments, Inc. (a subsidiary of FairlyWed, Inc.).</li>
  <li>If issued in China, the Data Controller is FairlyWed China, except if: (i) you book or create a Listing outside of China,
    (ii) book a Listing in China with a Vendor who is not a resident of China, or (iii) the booking was confirmed prior to
    December 7, 2016 at 10:00am UTC, in which case the Data Controller is FairlyWed Payments UK Ltd.</li>
  <li>If issued in India, the Data Controller is FairlyWed Payments India Pvt. Ltd., except if you use a Payout Method issued
    in India and accept a booking from a Guest with a Payment Method that is not issued in India, in which case the Data
    Controller is FairlyWed Payments UK Ltd.</li>
  <li>If issued outside of the United States, China, and India, the Data Controller is FairlyWed Payments UK Ltd.</li>
</ul>

<h4>1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h4>

</ul>

<h5>1.2 Information We Automatically Collect from Your Use of the FairlyWed Platform.</h5>

<p>When you use the FairlyWed Platform, we collect information about the services you use and how you use them.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Usage Information.</strong> We collect information about your interactions with the FairlyWed Platform, such as
    the pages or other content you view, your searches for Listings, bookings you have made, and other actions on the FairlyWed
    Platform.</li>
  <li><strong>Location Information.</strong> When you use certain features of the FairlyWed Platform, we may collect different
    types of information about your general location (e.g. IP address, zip code) or more specific location information (e.g.
    precise location from your mobile GPS). Most mobile devices allow you to control or disable the use of location services
    for applications in the device’s settings menu.</li>
  <li><strong>Log Data.</strong> We automatically collect log information when you use the FairlyWed Platform, even if you have
    not created a FairlyWed Account or logged in. That information includes, among other things: details about how you’ve
    used the FairlyWed Platform (including links to third party applications), IP address, access times, hardware and software
    information, device information, device event information (e.g., crashes, browser type), and the page you’ve viewed or
    engaged with before or after using the FairlyWed Platform.</li>
  <li><strong>Transaction Information.</strong> We collect information related to your transactions on the FairlyWed Platform,
    including the date and time, amounts charged, and other related transaction details.</li>
  <li><strong>Cookies and Similar Technologies.</strong> We use cookies and other similar technologies, such as web beacons,
    pixels, and mobile identifiers. We may also allow our business partners to use these tracking technologies on the FairlyWed
    Platform, or engage others to track your behavior on our behalf. While you may disable the usage of cookies through your
    browser settings, we do not change our practices in response to a “Do Not Track” signal in the HTTP header from your
    browser or mobile application. For more information on our use of these technologies, see our <a href="/terms/cookie_policy">Cookie Policy</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h5>1.3 Information We Collect from Third Parties.</h5>

<p>We may collect information that others provide about you when they use the FairlyWed Platform, or obtain information from
  other sources and combine that with information we collect through the FairlyWed Platform.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Third Party Services.</strong> If you link, connect, or login to your FairlyWed Account with a third party service
    (e.g., Facebook, WeChat), the third party service may send us information such as your registration and profile information
    from that service. This information varies and is controlled by that service or as authorized by you via your privacy
    settings at that service.</li>
  <li><strong>Your References.</strong> If someone has written a reference for you, it will be published on your FairlyWed public
    profile page. To learn more about how this works, see our Help Center article about <a href="/help/article/173/what-are-references-on-FairlyWed">References</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Background Information.</strong> For Members in the United States, to the extent permitted by applicable laws,
    FairlyWed may obtain reports from public records of criminal convictions or sex offender registrations. For Members outside
    of the United States, to the extent permitted by applicable laws, FairlyWed may obtain the local version of background
    or registered sex offender checks. We may use your information, including your full name and date of birth, to obtain
    such reports.</li>
  <li><strong>Other Sources.</strong> To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may receive additional information about
    you, such as demographic data or fraud detection information, from third party service providers and/or partners, and
    combine it with information we have about you. For example, we may receive background check results or fraud warnings
    from service providers like identity verification services for our fraud prevention and risk assessment efforts. We may
    receive information about you and your activities on and off the FairlyWed Platform through partnerships, or about your
    experiences and interactions from our partner ad networks.</li>

<h5>3.1 With Your Consent.</h5>

<p>We may share your information at your direction or as described at the time of sharing, such as when you authorize a third
  party application or website to access your FairlyWed Account.</p>

<h5>3.2 Sharing between Vendors, Guests and Co-Vendors.</h5>

<p>To help facilitate bookings, we may share your information with other Members as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When you as a Guest submit a booking request, certain information about you is shared with the Vendor (and Co-Vendor, if
    applicable), including your full name, the full name of any additional Guests, your cancellation history, and other information
    you agree to share. When your booking is confirmed, we will disclose additional information to assist with coordinating

    to coordinate the booking, such as your full name, phone number, and Accommodation or Experience address.</li>

</ul>

<p>We don’t share your billing and payout information with other Members.</p>

<h5>3.3 Profiles, Listings, and other Public Information.</h5>

<p>The FairlyWed Platform lets you publish information that is visible to the general public. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Parts of your public profile page, such as your first name, your description, and city, are publicly visible to others.</li>
  <li>Public Listing pages are publicly visible and include information such as the Accommodation or Experience’s approximate
    location (neighborhood and city), Listing description, calendar availability, the Vendor public profile photo, aggregated
    demand information (like page views over a period of time), and any additional information the Vendor chooses to share.</li>
  <li>After completing a booking, Guests and Vendors may write reviews and rate each other. Reviews are a part of your public
    profile page.</li>
  <li>If you submit content in a public forum or social media post, or use a similar feature on the FairlyWed Platform, that
    content is publicly visible.</li>
</ul>

<p>Information you share publicly on the FairlyWed Platform may be indexed through third party search engines. In some cases,
  you may opt-out of this feature in your Account settings. If you change your settings or your public-facing content, these
  search engines may not update their databases. We do not control the practices of third party search engines, and they
  may use caches containing your outdated information.</p>

<h5>3.4 Service Providers.</h5>

<p>We use a variety of third party service providers to help us provide services related to the FairlyWed Platform. Service
  providers may be located inside or outside of the European Economic Area (“<strong>EEA</strong>”). For example, service
  providers may help us: (i) verify or authenticate your identification, (ii) check information against public databases,
  (iii) assist us with background checks, fraud prevention, and risk assessment, or (iv) provide customer service, advertising,
  or payments services. These providers have limited access to your information to perform these tasks on our behalf, and
  are contractually obligated to use it consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h5>3.5 Additional Services by Vendors.</h5>

<p>Vendors may use third party services available through the FairlyWed Platform to assist with managing their Accommodation
  or providing additional services, such as cleaning services or lock providers. Vendors may use features on the FairlyWed
  Platform to share information about the Guest (like check-in and check-out dates, Guest name, Guest phone number, and Guest
  anonymized email address) with that third party service provider for the purposes of coordinating the stay, managing the
  Accommodation, or delivering other services.</p>

<h5>3.6 FairlyWed Payments.</h5>

<p>FairlyWed Payments may share your personal information to: (i) provide the Payment Services, (ii) facilitate your use of
  the FairlyWed Platform, and (iii) jointly market products or services to you with other financial third parties with whom
  FairlyWed Payments has a formal agreement. You can unsubscribe or opt-out from receiving such marketing communications
  in your Account settings.</p>

<h5>3.7 Safety and Compliance with Law.</h5>

<p>FairlyWed may disclose your information to courts, law enforcement or governmental authorities, or authorized third parties,
  if and to the extent we are required to do so by law or if such disclosure is reasonably necessary: (i) to comply with
  legal process and to respond to claims asserted against FairlyWed, (ii) to respond to verified requests relating to a criminal
  investigation or alleged or suspected illegal activity or any other activity that may expose us, you, or any other of our
  users to legal liability, (iii) to enforce and administer our <a ui-sref="policies.terms">Terms of Service</a> or other
  agreements with Members, (iv) for fraud investigation and prevention, risk assessment, customer support, product development
  and debugging purposes, or (v) to protect the rights, property or personal safety of FairlyWed, its employees, its Members,
  or members of the public.</p>

<p>We will attempt to notify Members about these requests unless: (i) providing notice is prohibited by the legal process itself,
  by court order we receive, or by applicable law, or (ii) we believe that providing notice would be futile, ineffective,
  create a risk of injury or bodily harm to an individual or group, or create or increase a risk of fraud upon FairlyWed’s
  property, its Members and the Platform (collectively, “<strong>Risk Scenarios</strong>”). In instances where we comply
  with legal requests without notice for these reasons, we will attempt to notify that Member about the request after the
  fact if we determine in good faith that we are no longer legally prohibited from doing so and that no Risk Scenarios apply.</p>

<h5>3.8 Corporate Affiliates.</h5>

<p>To help us provide the FairlyWed Platform, we may share your information within our corporate family of companies (both financial
  and non-financial entities) that are related by common ownership or control. These related entities are covered under this
  Privacy Policy, and when services have additional terms specific to them, we tell you through the FairlyWed Platform.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Sharing with FairlyWed Ireland.</strong> If you reside in the United States, some of your information may be shared

    number, (ii) information relating to the Listing or Vendor Service, including its address, (iii) booking information

      name, profile picture and message content.</li>
  </ul>

  differ from what is described in this Privacy Policy (including practices pertaining to disclosures to Chinese government
  agencies).</p>

<h5>3.9 Widgets.</h5>

<p>We may display parts of the FairlyWed Platform (e.g., your Listing page) on sites operated by FairlyWed’s business partners,
  using technologies such as widgets or APIs. If your Listings are displayed on a partner’s site, information from your public
  profile page may also be displayed.</p>

<h5>3.10 Tax Authorities.</h5>

<p>In jurisdictions where we facilitate the Collection and Remittance of Occupancy Taxes as described in the “Taxes” section
  of the <a ui-sref="policies.terms">Terms of Service</a>, Vendors and Guests expressly grant us permission, without further
  notice, to disclose Vendors’ and Guests’ data and other information relating to them or to their transactions, bookings,
  Accommodations and Occupancy Taxes to the relevant tax authority, including, but not limited to, the Vendor or Guest’s
  name, listing addresses, transaction dates and amounts, tax identification number(s), the amount of taxes received (or
  due) by Vendors from Guests, and contact information.</p>

<h5>3.11 Vendor Information Provided to Business Travel Program Customers.</h5>


<p>If a booking is designated as being for business purposes and made by a Guest affiliated with a company or other organization
  enrolled in our Business Travel Program (either or both an “<strong>Enterprise</strong>”), we may disclose information
  related to the booking to the Enterprise, such as the name of the Vendor, the Accommodation address, pricing, Listing details,
  and other related information. At the request of the Enterprise, we may also share this information with third parties
  engaged by it to provide travel management, financial reporting, personnel management, crisis management, or other services.</p>

<h5>3.12 Guest Information Provided to Business Travel Program Customers.</h5>

<p>If you have linked your FairlyWed Account with an Enterprise, and you are included on a booking designated as being for business
  purposes, we may disclose information related to the booking to your Enterprise. Typically, this includes your name, dates
  of the booking, number of guests, pricing, Listing details, the Accommodation address, and other related information. At
  the request of your Enterprise, we may also disclose this information to service providers engaged by it, such as companies
  that provide travel management, financial reporting, personnel management, crisis management, or other services. In the
  event of a dispute, emergency, or similar situation involving a booking identified as being for business purposes, FairlyWed
  may also share relevant information it believes is necessary to safely and quickly address the situation.</p>

<h5>3.13 Business Transfers.</h5>

<p>If FairlyWed undertakes or is involved in any merger, acquisition, reorganization, sale of assets, bankruptcy, or insolvency
  event, then we may sell, transfer or share some or all of our assets, including your information. In this event, we will
  notify you before your personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>

<h5>3.14 Aggregated Data.</h5>

<p>We may also share aggregated information (information about our users that we combine together so that it no longer identifies
  or references an individual user) and non-personally identifiable information for industry and market analysis, demographic
  profiling, marketing and advertising, and other business purposes.</p>

<h4>4. OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION</h4>

<h5>4.1 Analyzing your Communications.</h5>

<p>We may review, scan, or analyze your communications on the FairlyWed Platform for fraud prevention, risk assessment, regulatory
  compliance, investigation, product development, research, and customer support purposes. For example, as part of our fraud
  prevention efforts, we scan and analyze messages to mask contact information and references to other websites. In some
  cases, we may also scan, review, or analyze messages to debug, improve, and expand product offerings. We use automated
  methods where reasonably possible. However, occasionally we may need to manually review some communications, such as for
  fraud investigations and customer support, or to assess and improve the functionality of these automated tools. We will
  not review, scan, or analyze your communications to send third party marketing messages to you, and we will not sell reviews
  or analyses of these communications.</p>

      India Pvt. Ltd. (collectively, “FairlyWed Payments”) are responsible for processing your Personal Information in connection
      with Payments Services related to use of the FairlyWed Site, Application and Services. Additionally, if your FairlyWed

        <ul>
          <li><em>Mobile Data</em>

              zip code) and more specific information (e.g. GPS-based functionality on mobile devices used to access the

          </li>
          <li><em>Log Data</em>

            <p>We may also receive, store and process Log Data, which is information that is automatically recorded by our servers
              whenever you access or use the Platform, regardless of whether you are registered with FairlyWed or logged
              in to your FairlyWed Account, such as your IP Address, the date and time you access or use the Platform, the
              hardware and software you are using, referring and exit pages and URLs, the number of clicks, device event
              information, pages viewed and the order of those pages, and the amount of time spent on particular pages.</p>

          </li>
          <li><em>Cookies and other Tracking Technologies</em>

            <p>FairlyWed uses cookies and other similar technologies, such as mobile application and other device identifiers,
              on the Platform. We may also allow our business partners to use their cookies and other tracking technologies
              on the Platform. As a result, when you access or use the Platform, you will provide or make available certain
              information to us and to our business partners.</p>

            <p>While you may disable the usage of cookies through your browser settings, we do not change our practices in response
              to a “Do Not Track” signal in the HTTP header from your browser or mobile application. We track your activities
              if you click on advertisements for FairlyWed services on Third-Party platforms such as search engines and social
              networks, and may use analytics to track what you do in response to those advertisements.</p>

            <p>We may, either directly or through Third Parties we engage to provide services to us, also continue to track
              your behavior on our own Platform for purposes of our own customer support, analytics, research, product development,
              fraud prevention, risk assessment, regulatory compliance, investigation, as well as to enable you to use and
              access the Platform and pay for your activities on the Platform. We may also, either directly or through Third-Parties
              we engage to provide services to us, track your behavior on our own Platform to market and advertise our services
              to you on the Platform and Third-Party websites. Third Parties that use cookies and other tracking technologies
              to deliver targeted advertisements on our Platform and/or Third-Party websites may offer you a way to prevent
              such targeted advertisements by opting-out at the websites of industry groups such as the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/"><em>Network Advertising Initiative</em></a>              and/or the <em><a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">Digital Advertising Alliance</a>.</em> You may also
              be able to control advertising cookies provided by publishers, for example Google’s <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/"><em>Ad Preference Manager</em></a>.
              Please note that even if you choose to opt-out of receiving targeted advertising, you may still receive advertising
              on or about the Platform – it just will not be tailored to your interests. In addition, if you disable cookies,
              you may lose some of the features and functionality of using our Platform, Application and Services, as cookies
              are necessary to track and enhance your use and access.</p>

            <p>Third Parties may not collect information about users’ online activities on the Platform except as described
              in this policy and our <a href="/terms/privacy_policy#cookie_policy"><em>Cookie Policy</em></a>.</p>

          </li>
          <li><em>Third-Party social plugins</em>

            <p>Our Platform may use social plugins which are provided and operated by Third-Parties, such as Facebook’s Like
              Button.</p>

            <p>As a result of this, you may send to the Third-Party the information that you are viewing on a certain part of
              our Platform. If you are not logged into your account with the Third-Party, then the Third Party may not know
              your identity. If you are logged into your account with the Third Party, then the Third Party may be able to
              link information about your visit to our Platform to your account with them. Similarly, your interactions with
              the social plugin may be recorded by the Third Party.</p>

            <p>Please refer to the Third Party’s privacy policy to find out more about its data practices, such as what data
              is collected about you and how the Third Party uses such data.</p>

  <li><strong>HOW FairlyWed USES AND PROCESSES THE INFORMATION THAT YOU PROVIDE OR MAKE AVAILABLE</strong>
    <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">
      <li><strong>We use, store and process information about you for the following general purposes:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>to enable you to access and use the Platform;</li>
          <li>to enable you to communicate with other Members, including but not limited to by sending them messages or other
            information during the Booking process;</li>
          <li>to operate, protect, improve and optimize the Platform, FairlyWed’s business, and our users’ experience, such as
            to perform analytics, conduct research, personalize or otherwise customize your experience, and to provide customer
            service;</li>
          <li>to help create and maintain a trusted and safer environment on the Platform and Services, such as detection and
            prevention of actual and potential fraud and other harmful activity, conducting investigations and risk assessments,
            enforcing our Terms and policies, verifying the address of your listings, verifying any identifications provided
            by you (including by comparing the photo on that identification to another photo you provide to us), and conducting
            checks against databases and information sources (such as but not limited to public government databases) for
            fraud detection and prevention, risk assessment and harm prevention purposes. In this regard, we may do any or
            all of the foregoing with or without further notifying you;</li>
          <li>to send you service, support and administrative messages, reminders, technical notices, updates, security alerts,
            and information requested by you;</li>
          <li>to send you marketing, advertising, and promotional messages and other information that may be of interest to you,
            including information about FairlyWed, our services, or general promotions for partner campaigns and services.
            You can unsubscribe or opt-out from receiving these communications in your settings (in the “Account” section)
            when you login to your FairlyWed Account;</li>
          <li>if a Guest has an employment or consulting relationship with a company or other organization that participates
            in the FairlyWed Business Travel Program, and that Guest has linked their FairlyWed Account to that organization,
            to administer the FairlyWed Business Travel Program;</li>
          <li>to administer referral programs, rewards, surveys, sweepstakes, contests, or other promotional activities or events
            sponsored or managed by FairlyWed or our Third Party business partners; and</li>
          <li>to comply with our legal obligations, resolve any disputes that we may have with any of our users, and enforce
            our agreements with Third Parties.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>How FairlyWed Uses and Processes User Communications</strong>

        <p>We may, either directly or through Third-Parties we engage to provide services to us, review, scan, or analyze your
          communications with other users exchanged via the Platform for fraud prevention, risk assessment, regulatory compliance,
          investigation, product development, research and customer support purposes. For example, as part of our fraud prevention
          efforts, the Platform may scan and analyze messages and attachments to mask contact information and references
          to other websites. This helps to prevent fraudulent actors from asking Guests to send them money outside of the
          Platform, such as by bank transfer or other money transfer methods. We may also scan, review or analyze messages
          for research and product development purposes to help make search, booking and user communications more efficient
          and effective, as well as to debug, improve and expand product offerings. We will not review, scan, or analyze
          your communications for sending Third-Party marketing messages to you. We will also not sell these reviews or analyses
          of communications to Third Parties. We will also use automated methods to carry out these reviews or analyses where
          reasonably possible. However, from time to time we may have to manually review some communications. By using the
          Platform, you consent that FairlyWed, in its sole discretion, may, either directly or through Third-Parties we
          engage to provide services to us, review, scan, analyze, and store your communications, whether done manually or
          through automated means.</p>

      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><strong>WHEN FairlyWed DISCLOSES OR SHARES YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION, AND TO WHOM</strong>

    <p><strong>IMPORTANT: When you use the Platform, your data may be sent to the United States and possibly other countries in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</strong></p>

    <p>We may transfer, store, use and process your information, including any Personal Information, to countries outside of
      the European Economic Area (“<strong>EEA</strong>”) including the United States and possibly other countries. By using
      the Platform, you consent to transferring your data to these countries. Please note that laws vary from jurisdiction
      to jurisdiction, and so laws and regulations relating to privacy and data disclosure, applicable to the places where
      your information is transferred to or stored, used or processed in, may be different from the laws and regulations
      applicable to the place where you are resident.</p>

    <p>FairlyWed, Inc. complies with the US-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework and principles, as described in its certification (https://safeharbor.export.gov/companyinfo.aspx?loc=swiss&id=32707)
      If you are located in Switzerland, please also see our Safe Harbor Notice (https://www.FairlyWed.ch/terms/safe_harbor_notice).</p>

    <p>In addition, if you reside outside of China and you create a Listing in China, book an Accommodation in China or message
      the Vendor of a Listing in China, this paragraph applies to you: When you take any action that would result in any
      transfer, storage, use or processing of your Personal Information in or to China, we will notify you before any such
      transfer, storage, use or processing is undertaken. We will also notify you if we adopt any practices for China that
      differ from what is described in this Privacy Policy, including any practices pertaining to disclosures to Chinese
      government agencies; otherwise all of the provisions of this Privacy Policy will apply.</p>

    <p>Your Personal Information may be transferred, stored, used, processed and disclosed as follows:</p>

    <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">
      <li>Parts of your public profile page that contain some Personal Information may be displayed in other parts of the Platform
        to other users for marketing purposes or if you post content in a community forum or other features on the Platform
        that are visible to the general public.</li>
      <li>Your public Listing page will always include some minimum information such as the city and neighborhood where the Accommodation
        is located, your listing description, your calendar availability, your public profile photo, your responsiveness
        in replying to Guests’ queries, and any additional information you share with other Members. Your public Listing
        page may also include aggregated demand information (such as number of page views over a period of time). Parts of
        your public Listing page may be displayed in other parts of the Platform to other Members and/or Third Party platforms
        for marketing purposes. The Platform may also display the Accommodation’s approximate geographic location on a map,
        such that a user can see the general area of the Accommodation.</li>
      <li>The Platform allows your public profile and public Listing pages to be included in search engines, in which case your
        public profile and public Listing pages will be indexed by search engines and may be published as search results.
        This option is enabled by default, and you may opt out of this feature by changing your settings on the Platform.
        If you change your settings or the information on your public profile or public Listing pages, Third-Party search
        engines may not update their databases quickly or at all. We do not control the practices of Third-Party search engines,
        and they may use caches containing outdated information, including any information indexed by the search engine before
        you change your settings or the information on your public profile or public Listing pages.</li>
      <li>When you submit a request to book an Accommodation, your full name, and the full name of any confirmed Guests staying
        with you, and other Personal Information you agree to pass through to the Vendor(s) will become visible to the Vendor(s)
        of any Listing you Book or request to Book. We may also disclose parts of your public profile; your public Wish List;
        other Member reviews of you; and any additional information you share with other Members. In addition, if you agree
        to be contacted by the Vendor(s) by phone before your request to Book is accepted, and the Vendor(s) decides to do
        so, FairlyWed will call your phone number first, before connecting you with the Vendor(s). We will not share your
        phone number unless there is a confirmed booking; if there is a confirmed booking, your phone number will become
        visible to the Vendor(s)/Guest, who may call you directly.</li>
      <li>When your request to book an Accommodation is accepted by the Vendor(s) or when a Guest books your Accommodation, we
        will disclose some of your Personal Information to the Vendor(s) and any confirmed Guest(s). However, your billing
        and payout information will never be shared with another user.</li>
      <li>If a Guest books an Accommodation for a business trip, and the Guest is engaged or employed by a company or other organization
        (either or both a “<strong>Guest Affiliated Organization</strong>”) that is enrolled in our Business Travel Program,
        we may disclose the name of the Vendor and the address and other Accommodation information to the Guest Affiliated
        Organization. If the Guest or the Guest Affiliated Organization uses any Third Party for travel management, financial
        reporting and/or travel related crisis management services (collectively, “<strong>Business Travel Services</strong>”),
        we may also share Vendor and Accommodation information with those Third Parties and any service providers of those
        Third Parties who participate in providing such Business Travel Services.</li>
      <li>Notwithstanding that you do not reside in China, some of your Personal Information will be transferred to, stored,
        used and processed by FairlyWed China in the following circumstances:
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
          <li>When you create a Listing in China, (i) your name and phone number, (ii) all information relating to the Listing
            including its address, (iii) booking information relating to the Listing (such as Guest details as set out in
            paragraph (b) below, booking dates and payment amounts), and (iv) messages between you and prospective and confirmed
            Guests at the Listing.</li>
          <li>When you book an Accommodation in China, (i) your name and phone number, (ii) booking dates, (iii) messages between
            you and the Vendor, and (iv) the names, nationality(ies), passport/national ID number(s) and passport expiry
            date(s) of the guest(s).</li>
          <li>When you send a message to a Vendor in relation to that Vendor’s Listing in China, your first name, profile picture
            and message content via the FairlyWed platform.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>When a Vendor accepts your request to book an Accommodation, the Vendor may elect to use Third-Party services available
        through the FairlyWed platform to assist with managing the Accommodation, such as cleaning services and lock providers.
        The Vendor may use features on the FairlyWed platform to share information about the Guest with that Third-Party
        service provider for the purposes of coordinating the stay or managing the Accommodation, including check-in and
        check-out dates, Guest name, Guest’s phone number, and the Guest’s anonymized email address.</li>
      <li>If you as a Guest are associated with a Guest Affiliated Organization, we may share with it information related to
        your bookings through the Business Travel Program. Further, if you have linked your FairlyWed Account to a Guest
        Affiliated Organization and indicate that a booking is for business purposes, we may disclose your booking information
        (which may include your Personal Information) to such organization. Typically this information will include your
        name, dates of the booking, number of guests, cost of the booking, and the address of the booking. In addition, if
        your Guest Affiliated Organization has requested that we provide it with information in the event of a dispute, emergency
        or similar situation involving your bookings through the Business Travel Program, we may notify such organization
        of the situation and disclose to it any information, including your Personal Information, that we believe in good
        faith is necessary to safely and quickly resolve or address the situation. If you or your Guest Affiliated Organization
        uses a Third Party for travel management, financial reporting, and/or travel related crisis management services,
        we may also disclose your booking information, or information related to a dispute, emergency or similar situation
        involving you, to those Third Parties and any service providers of those Third Parties who participate in providing
        such services.</li>
      <li>When a Guest stays at your Accommodation or when you stay at a Vendor’s Accommodation, we may ask you to review the
        Guest, Vendor, or the Accommodation. If you choose to provide a review, your review may be public on the Platform.
        Likewise, another Member’s review of you as a Guest or Vendor may be public on the Platform.</li>
      <li>You may link your account on a Third-Party social networking site to your FairlyWed Account. We refer to a person’s
        contacts on these Third-Party sites as “Friends”. When you create this linkage:
        <ul>
          <li>some of the information you provide to us from the linking of your accounts may be published on your FairlyWed
            Account profile;</li>
          <li>your activities on the Platform may be displayed to your Friends on the Platform and/or that Third-Party site;</li>
          <li>a link to your public profile on that Third-Party social networking site may be included in your FairlyWed public
            profile;</li>
          <li>other FairlyWed users may be able to see any common Friends that you may have with them, or that you are a Friend
            of their Friend if applicable;</li>
          <li>other FairlyWed users may be able to see any schools, hometowns or other groups you have in common with them as
            listed on your linked social networking site(s);</li>
          <li>the information you provide to us from the linking of your accounts may be stored, processed and transmitted for
            fraud prevention and risk assessment purposes; and</li>
          <li>the publication and display of information that you provide to FairlyWed through this linkage is subject to your
            settings and authorizations on the Platform and the Third-Party site.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>We may distribute parts of the Platform (including your Listing) for display on sites operated by FairlyWed’s business
        partners and affiliates, using technologies such as HTML widgets. If and when your Listings are displayed on a partner’s
        site, information from your public profile page may also be displayed.</li>
      <li>FairlyWed may provide your Personal Information to its Affiliates, including FairlyWed Payments, and their employees,
        to use and process your Personal Information in the same way and to the same extent that we are permitted to under
        this Privacy Policy. These related entities comply with the same obligations that we have to protect your Personal
        Information under this Privacy Policy. FairlyWed Payments may share your Personal Information for (i) their everyday
        business purposes; (ii) to jointly market products or services to you with other financial Third Parties with whom
        FairlyWed Payments has a formal agreement; and (iii) with respect to information about your transactions and experiences
        only, for their Affiliates’ everyday purposes. You can unsubscribe or opt-out from receiving marketing communications
        in your settings (in the “Account” section) when you login to your FairlyWed account.</li>
      <li>We may also engage Third Parties, who may be located outside of the EEA, to provide services to us, including but not
        limited to technology services and services to help verify your identification, to help match the photo on your ID
        to other photos of yourself you send to us, to conduct checks against databases such as but not limited to public
        government databases (where legally allowed), to otherwise assist us with fraud prevention and risk assessment, to
        assist us with customer service, to serve targeted ads, and to facilitate the payments or reimbursements you request
        (such as Concur and American Express). We may provide Personal Information about you to these Third Parties, or give
        them access to this Personal Information, for the limited purpose of allowing them to provide these services. For
        example, if we hire Third Parties, where permitted by applicable law, to conduct checks against databases such as
        but not limited to public government databases, we may provide your Personal Information, such as your full name
        and date of birth, to the Third Parties for the limited purpose of allowing them to conduct such checks, including
        background or registered sex offender checks, on our behalf. We will ensure that such Third Parties have contractual
        obligations to protect this Personal Information and to not use it for unrelated purposes.</li>
      <li>For any jurisdiction in which we facilitate the Collection and Remittance of Taxes or Opt-in for Vendor Remittance
        of Taxes as described in the “Taxes” section of the <a ui-sref="policies.terms"><em>Terms of Service</em></a>, Vendors
        and Guests expressly grant us permission, without further notice, to store, transfer and disclose data and other
        information relating to them or to their transactions, bookings, Accommodations and Occupancy Taxes, including, but
        not limited to, personally identifiable information such as Vendor or Guest’s name, listing addresses, transaction
        dates and amounts, tax identification number(s), the amount of taxes received by Vendors from Guests, or allegedly
        due, contact information and similar information, to the relevant Tax Authority.</li>
      <li>You acknowledge, consent and agree that FairlyWed may access, preserve and disclose your account information and Collective
        Content if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access, preservation or disclosure is reasonably
        necessary (a) to respond to claims asserted against FairlyWed; (b) to comply with legal process (for example, subpoenas
        and warrants), including legal process associated with national security and law enforcement; (c) to enforce and
        administer our agreements with users, such as the <a ui-sref="policies.terms"><em>Terms of Service</em></a>, the
        <a href="/terms/payments_terms"><em>Payments Terms of Service</em></a>, this Privacy Policy, and the <a href="/terms/host_guarantee"><em>Vendor Guarantee Terms and Conditions</em></a>;
        (d) for fraud prevention, risk assessment, investigation, customer support, product development and de-bugging purposes;
        or (e) to protect the rights, property or personal safety of FairlyWed, its users or members of the public.

        <p>We will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify users about law enforcement requests for their data unless:

          <ul>
            <li>providing notice is prohibited by the legal process itself, by court order we receive, or by applicable law;
              or</li>
            <li>we believe that providing notice would (a) be futile, (b) be ineffective, or (c) would create a risk of injury
              or bodily harm to an individual or group, or (d) create or increase a risk of fraud upon FairlyWed’s property,
              its Members, the Platform, Application, or Services (collectively, “<strong>Risk Scenarios</strong>”).</li>
          </ul>

          <p>In instances where FairlyWed complies with legal requests for user data without notice to the user for the reasons
            described above, FairlyWed will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify that user about the request after
            the fact if we determine in good faith that we are no longer legally prohibited from doing so and that no Risk
            Scenarios apply.</p>

      </li>
      <li>We may also publish, disclose and use Aggregated Information and non-personal information for industry and market analysis,
        demographic profiling, marketing and advertising, and other business purposes.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><strong>STATE PRIVACY LAWS</strong>

  </li>
  <li><strong>BUSINESS TRANSFERS BY FairlyWed</strong>

    <p>If FairlyWed undertakes or is involved in any merger, acquisition, reorganization, sale of assets or bankruptcy or insolvency
      event, then we may sell, transfer or share some or all of our assets, including your Personal Information. In this

      policy.</p>

  </li>
  <li><strong>HOW TO ACCESS, CHANGE OR DELETE YOUR INFORMATION, OR CANCEL YOUR FairlyWed ACCOUNT</strong>

  </li>
  <li><strong>SECURING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong>

    <p>We are continuously implementing and updating administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect
      your Personal Information against unauthorized access, destruction or alteration. However, no method of transmission
      over the Internet, and no method of storing electronic information, can be 100% secure. So, we cannot guarantee the
      security of your transmissions to us and of your Personal Information that we store.</p>

  </li>
  <li><strong>YOUR PRIVACY WHEN YOU ACCESS THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES AND RESOURCES</strong>

    <p>The Platform will contain links to other websites not owned or controlled by FairlyWed. FairlyWed does not have any control
      over Third-Party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies, web beacons or other files on your device,
      or collect and solicit Personal Information from you. They will have their own rules about the collection, use and
      disclosure of Personal Information. We encourage you to read the terms of use and privacy policies of the other websites
      that you visit.</p>

    <p>Some portions of the Platform implement Google Maps/Earth mapping services, including Google Maps API(s). Your use of
      Google Maps/Earth is subject to Google’s terms of use (located at <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en_us/help/terms_maps.html"><em>www.google.com/intl/en_us/help/terms_maps.html</em></a>)
      and Google’s privacy policy (located at<a href="http://www.google.com/privacy.html"><em>www.google.com/privacy.html</em></a>),
      as may be amended by Google from time to time</p>

  </li>
  <li><strong>SPECIAL FEATURES AND PROGRAMS</strong>

    <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">
      <li><strong>Referral service and requesting references</strong>

        <p>The Platform provides a referral service that allows you to invite your friends and contacts to use the Platform.
          The Platform also allows you to ask your friends and contacts to write a reference for you, to be published on
          your FairlyWed profile.</p>

        <p>We may integrate the Platform with third party sites such as Facebook, so that you can send invitation messages or
          requests for references via the third party site itself. These messages will be sent by the third party site, and
          FairlyWed does not collect or retain the contact information that is used to send them.</p>

        <p>You may also send invitation/request emails via the Platform itself, in which case we will ask you for the contact
          information to which to send your invitation/request. You can type in the email addresses or other contact information
          manually, or you can choose to import the contacts in your address book(s). In both cases, we may use and store
          this information for the sole purposes of allowing you to send your friends and contacts an invitation or request
          for a reference, and for fraud detection and prevention. With respect to referrals, we will also store the email
          addresses of your invitees to track if your friend joins FairlyWed in response to your referral.</p>

        <p>If you request us to import your contacts, we will collect, but not store, the username and password for the email
          account you wish to import your contacts from. We will use this information only for the purpose of importing your
          contacts.</p>

      </li>
      <li><strong>Affiliate Program</strong>

        <p>If you are allowed to join FairlyWed’s <em><a href="/affiliates">Affiliate Program</a></em> and you sign up for it,
          you will have to provide us with certain Personal Information to enable us to provide the Affiliate Program to
          you.</p>

      </li>
      <li><strong>Meetups</strong>

        <p>The Platform may allow registered account holders to organize, search for or participate in offline events (“<strong>Meetups</strong>”)
          in selected cities.</p>

        <p>If you organize a Meetup or indicate that you will attend one, this information, together with some of your public
          information (such as your profile picture and public profile page) and any messages that you post about that Meetup,
          will be visible to users who browse the event. However, FairlyWed will never disclose where you are staying to
          another meetup user.</p>

      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><strong>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</strong>

    <p>We may change how we collect and then use Personal Information at any time and without prior notice, at our sole discretion.
      We may change this Privacy Policy at any time. If we make material changes to the Privacy Policy, we will notify you
      either by posting the changed Privacy Policy on the Platform or by sending an email to you. We will also update the
      “Last Updated” date at the top of this Privacy Policy. If we let you know of changes through an email communication,
      then the date on which we send the email will be deemed to be the date of your receipt of that email.</p>

    <p>It’s important that you review the changed Privacy Policy. If you do not wish to agree to the changed Privacy Policy,
      then we will not be able to continue providing the Platform and Services to you, and your only option will be to stop
      accessing the Platform and Services and deactivate your FairlyWed Account. You can find out more about how to deactivate
      your FairlyWed Account at <a href="/help"><em>www.FairlyWed.com/help</em></a>.</p>

      provide you with a copy of the Personal Information held by us as soon as practicable and in any event not more than
      40 days after receiving a valid request in writing. There may be a charge to access your personal data (which will

      protection legislation. All requests should be addressed to our Data Protection Compliance Officer, FairlyWed Ireland,

  </li>
  <li><strong>FOR USERS RESIDING IN THE EU: YOUR RIGHT TO SEE AND CHALLENGE INFORMATION PROVIDED TO US BY THIRD PARTIES</strong>

    <p>You are entitled to see and challenge any information that Third Parties may provide to us as part of our fraud detection,
      prevention and risk assessment efforts in circumstances where all of the following factors apply: (i) if we use Third
      Parties to carry out automated checks or risk assessments, and (ii) if we make a decision which has legal consequences
      for you or which significantly affects you, and (iii) if such decision is based solely on such automated checks or
      risk assessments. In order to request this, please address your request directly to FairlyWed Ireland, Privacy Office,
      Watermarque Building, South Lotts Road, Ringsend, Dublin 4, Ireland. Please state clearly in your request that you
      wish to see and/or challenge the information that Third Parties may have provided to FairlyWed as part of our fraud
      detection, prevention and risk assessment efforts. We may request proof of identification to verify your request.</p>

    <p>FairlyWed is subject to the authority of the Federal Trade Commission and has certified with the Privacy Shield as required
      by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data from the European
      Union member countries. FairlyWed certifies that it adheres to the Privacy Shield principles of notice, choice, onward
      transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. Consistent with these principles, where FairlyWed uses
      service providers to process personal data of European Union residents, FairlyWed shall remain liable where the agent
      processes such personal data of European Union residents in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield principles,
      except where FairlyWed establishes that FairlyWed is not responsible for the damages caused by the agent. To learn
      more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view the list of entities who have current certifications under the Privacy
      Shield, please visit the <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/list">U.S. Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield List</a>.</p>

    <p>If you have any questions or complaints about FairlyWed’s privacy practices, you may contact FairlyWed at FairlyWed Ireland,
      Privacy Office, Watermarque Building, South LottsRoad, Ringsend, Dublin 4, Ireland, and we will work with you to resolve
      your issue. As a resident of the European Union, you may also contact your appropriate European Data Protection Authority
      with questions or complaints about our privacy practices.</p>

    <p>Residents of the European Union who are dissatisfied with the way in which we have addressed your concerns about our
      privacy practices may seek further assistance from our designated Privacy Shield independent recourse mechanism,
      <a
        href="https://www.jamsadr.com/">JAMS</a>.</p>

    <p>Residents of the European Union who have unresolved complaints after: (1) contacting FairlyWed to resolve the issue;
      (2) seeking assistance from our independent recourse mechanism; and (3) contacting the U.S. Department of Commerce
      (either directly or through a European Data Protection Authority) and giving the Department of Commerce time to attempt
      to resolve the issue, may elect to arbitrate certain claims. See <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=ANNEX-I-introduction">here</a>      for more details.

  </li>
  <li><strong>COOKIE POLICY</strong>

    <p>FairlyWed uses “cookies” in conjunction with the Platform to obtain information. A cookie is a small data file that is
      transferred to your device (e.g. your phone or your computer) for record-keeping purposes. For example, a cookie could
      allow the Platform to recognize your browser, while another could store your preferences and other information.</p>

    <p>Your browser may allow you to set how it handles cookies, such as declining all cookies or prompting you to decide whether
      to accept each cookie. But please note that some parts of the Platform may not work as intended or may not work at
      all without cookies.</p>

    <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">
      <li><strong>FairlyWed cookies and Third Party cookies</strong>

        <p>FairlyWed may place our cookies on your device via the Platform. Accordingly, our Privacy Policy will apply to our
          treatment of the information we obtain via our cookies.</p>

        <p>We may also allow our business partners to place cookies on your device. For example, we use Google Analytics for
          web analytics, and so Google may also set cookies on your device. As further explained below, Third Parties may
          also place cookies on your device for advertising purposes.</p>

        <p>There are two types of cookies used on the Platform, namely “<strong>persistent cookies</strong>” and “<strong>session cookies</strong>”.</p>

        <p>Session cookies will normally expire when you close your browser, while persistent cookies will remain on your device
          after you close your browser, and can be used again the next time you access the Platform.</p>

      </li>
      <li><strong>Other technologies</strong>

        <p>The Platform may also use other technologies with similar functionality to cookies, such as web beacons and tracking
          URLs to obtain Log Data about users. We may also use web beacons and tracking URLs in our messages to you to determine
          whether you have opened a certain message or accessed a certain link.</p>

      </li>
      <li><strong>Uses for FairlyWed cookies</strong>

        <p>FairlyWed uses cookies and similar tracking technologies for a number of purposes, such as the following:

          <ul>
            <li>to enable, facilitate and streamline the functioning of the Platform across different webpages, devices and browser
              sessions.</li>
            <li>to simplify your access to and use of the Platform and make it more seamless.</li>
            <li>to monitor and analyze the performance, operation and effectiveness of the Platform, so that we can improve and
              optimize it.</li>
            <li>to show you content (which may include advertisements) that is more relevant to you.</li>
            <li>for fraud detection and prevention.</li>
          </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Uses for Third-Party cookies</strong>

        <p>Our partners’ cookies are intended to obtain information to help them provide services to FairlyWed. For example,
          Third Parties we engage to provide services to us may track your behavior on our Platform to market and advertise
          FairlyWed listings or services to you on the Platform and Third-party websites, or to help us detect or prevent
          fraud or conduct risk assessments. Third Parties websites that use cookies and other tracking technologies to deliver
          targeted advertisements on our Platform and/or Third-Party websites may offer you a way to prevent such targeted
          advertisements by opting-out at the websites of industry groups such as the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/"><em>Network Advertising Initiative</em></a>          and/or the <a href="/terms/%5Bhttp:/www.aboutads.info/choices/"><em>Digital Advertising Alliance</em></a>. You
          may also be able to control advertising cookies provided by publishers, for example Google’s <a href="http://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/"><em>Ad Preference Manager</em></a>.
          Please note that even if you choose to opt-out of receiving targeted advertising, you may still receive advertising
          on or about the Platform – it just will not be tailored to your interests.</p>

        <p>In addition, Facebook places a cookie via the Platform that allows Facebook to obtain aggregated, non-Personal Information
          to optimize their services. For example, if a user clicks on an advertisement for the FairlyWed mobile app on Facebook
          and subsequently installs the app, this cookie will inform Facebook that a user (who is not personally identified)
          has installed the app after clicking on the advertisement. This cookie may also inform Facebook that a user is
          using the app, without identifying the specific actions taken by the user in the app.</p>

      </li>
      <li><strong>Disabling Cookies</strong>

        <p>Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can modify your browser setting to decline cookies by visiting
          the Help portion of your browser’s toolbar. If you choose to decline cookies, please note that you may not be able
          to sign in, customize, or use some of the interactive features of the Platform. Flash cookies operate differently
          than browser cookies, and cookie management tools available in a web browser will not remove flash cookies. To
          learn more about how to manage flash cookies, you can visit the the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/"><em>Adobe website</em></a>          and make changes at the <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager02.html"><em>Global Privacy Settings Panel</em></a>.</p>

      </li>
      <li><strong>Changes to this Cookie Policy</strong>

        <p>We can change this Cookie Policy at any time. If we make material changes to the Cookie Policy, we will let you know
          either by posting the changed Cookie Policy on the Platform or by sending you an email.</p>

        <p>It’s important that you review the changed Cookie Policy. If you do not wish to agree to the changed Cookie Policy,
          then we cannot continue to provide the Platform to you, and your only option is to stop accessing the Platform
          and Services and deactivate your FairlyWed Account. You can find out more about how to deactivate your FairlyWed
          Account at <a href="/help"><em>www.FairlyWed.com/help</em></a>.</p>
