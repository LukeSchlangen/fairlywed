<h1>FairlyWed Cookie Policy</h1>

<p>Last Updated: September 8, 2017</p>

<p>FairlyWed uses cookies and similar technologies to help provide, protect, and improve the FairlyWed Platform. This policy explains how and why we use these technologies and the choices you have.</p>

<p>A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your device (e.g. your phone or your computer). For example, a cookie could allow us to recognize your browser, while another could store your preferences. There are two types of cookies used on the FairlyWed Platform: (1) “session cookies” and (2) “persistent cookies.” Session cookies normally expire when you close your browser, while persistent cookies remain on your device after you close your browser, and can be used again the next time you access the FairlyWed Platform.</p>

<p>We also use other technologies with similar functionality to cookies, such as web beacons, pixels, mobile identifiers, and tracking URLs, to obtain Log Data (as described in the <a ui-sref="policies.privacy">Privacy Policy</a>). For example, our email messages may contain web beacons and tracking URLs to determine whether you have opened a certain message or accessed a certain link.</p>

<h5>Why FairlyWed Uses These Technologies</h5>

<h5>Third Parties</h5>

<p>We may also allow certain business partners to place these technologies on the FairlyWed Platform. These partners use these technologies to (1) help us analyze how you use the FairlyWed Platform, such as by noting the third party services from which you arrived, (2) market and advertise FairlyWed services to you on the FairlyWed Platform and third party websites, (3) help us detect or prevent fraud or conduct risk assessments, or (4) collect information about your activities on the FairlyWed Platform, other sites, and/or the ads you have clicked on. For example, to help us better understand how people use the FairlyWed Platform, we work with a number of analytics partners, including Google Analytics. To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser by <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">clicking here</a>.</p>

<p>Third parties may also use such tracking technologies to serve ads that they believe are most likely to be of interest to you and measure the effectiveness of their ads both on the FairlyWed Platform and on other websites and online services. Targeting and advertising cookies we use may include Google, and other advertising networks and services we use from time to time. For more information about targeting and advertising cookies and how you can opt out, you can visit the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">Network Advertising Initiative’s opt-out page</a>, the <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">Digital Advertising Alliance’s opt-out page</a>, or <a href="http://youronlinechoices.eu/">http://youronlinechoices.eu</a>. To opt out of Google Analytics for display advertising or customize Google display network ads, you can visit the <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads">Google Ads Settings</a> page. To the extent advertising technology is integrated into the FairlyWed Platform and you opt-out of tailored advertising, you may still receive advertising content. In that case, the advertising content will just not be tailored to your interests. Also, we do not control any of these opt-out links and are not responsible for the availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.</p>

<h5>Third Party Social Plugins</h5>

<p>The FairlyWed Platform may use social plugins provided and operated by third parties, such as Facebook’s Like Button. As a result of this, you may send to the third party the information that you are viewing on a certain part of the FairlyWed Platform. If you are not logged into your account with the third party, then the third party may not know your identity. If you are logged in to your account with the third party, then the third party may be able to link information or actions about your interactions with the FairlyWed Platform to your account with them. Please refer to the third party’s privacy policies to learn more about its data practices.</p>
