<h4>1. Scope of FairlyWed Services</h4>

<p>1.1 The FairlyWed Platform is an online marketplace that enables registered users (“<strong>Members</strong>”) and certain
  third parties who offer services (Members and third parties who offer services are “<strong>Vendors</strong>” and the services
  they offer are “<strong>Vendor Services</strong>”) to publish such Vendor Services on the FairlyWed Platform (“<strong>Listings</strong>”)
  and to communicate and transact directly with Members that are seeking to book such Vendor Services (Members using Vendor
  Services are “<strong>Guests</strong>”). Vendor Services may include the offering of vacation or other properties for use
  (&quot;<strong>Accommodations</strong>&quot;), single or multi-day activities in various categories (“<strong>Experiences</strong>”),
  access to unique events and locations (“<strong>Events</strong>”), and a variety of other travel and non-travel related
  services.</p>

<p>1.2 As the provider of the FairlyWed Platform, FairlyWed does not own, create, sell, resell, provide, control, manage, offer,
  deliver, or supply any Listings or Vendor Services. Vendors alone are responsible for their Listings and Vendor Services.
  When Members make or accept a booking, they are entering into a contract directly with each other. FairlyWed is not and
  does not become a party to or other participant in any contractual relationship between Members, nor is FairlyWed a real
  estate broker or insurer. FairlyWed is not acting as an agent in any capacity for any Member, except as specified in the
  <a href="/terms/payments_terms">Payments Terms</a>.</p>

<p>1.3 While we may help facilitate the resolution of disputes, FairlyWed has no control over and does not guarantee (i) the
  existence, quality, safety, suitability, or legality of any Listings or Vendor Services, (ii) the truth or accuracy of
  any Listing descriptions, Ratings, Reviews, or other Member Content (as defined below), or (iii) the performance or conduct
  of any Member or third party. FairlyWed does not endorse any Member, Listing or Vendor Services. Any references to a Member
  being &quot;verified&quot; (or similar language) only indicate that the Member has completed a relevant verification or
  identification process and nothing else. Any such description is not an endorsement, certification or guarantee by FairlyWed
  about any Member, including of the Member's identity or background or whether the Member is trustworthy, safe or suitable.
  You should always exercise due diligence and care when deciding whether to stay in an Accommodation, participate in an
  Experience or Event or use other Vendor Services, accept a booking request from a Guest, or communicate and interact with
  other Members, whether online or in person. Verified Images (as defined below) are intended only to indicate a photographic
  representation of a Listing at the time the photograph was taken, and are therefore not an endorsement by FairlyWed of
  any Vendor or Listing.</p>

<p>1.4 If you choose to use the FairlyWed Platform as a Vendor or Co-Vendor (as defined below), your relationship with FairlyWed
  is limited to being an independent, third-party contractor, and not an employee, agent, joint venturer or partner of FairlyWed
  for any reason, and you act exclusively on your own behalf and for your own benefit, and not on behalf, or for the benefit,
  of FairlyWed.</p>

<p>1.5 To promote the FairlyWed Platform and to increase the exposure of Listings to potential Guests, Listings and other Member
  Content may be displayed on other websites, in applications, within emails, and in online and offline advertisements. To
  assist Members who speak different languages, Listings and other Member Content may be translated, in whole or in part,
  into other languages. FairlyWed cannot guarantee the accuracy or quality of such translations and Members are responsible
  for reviewing and verifying the accuracy of such translations. The FairlyWed Platform may contain translations powered
  by Google. Google disclaims all warranties related to the translations, express or implied, including any warranties of
  accuracy, reliability, and any implied warranties for merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and noninfringement.</p>

<p>1.6 The FairlyWed Platform may contain links to third-party websites or resources (“<strong>Third-Party Services</strong>”).
  Such Third-Party Services may be subject to different terms and conditions and privacy practices. FairlyWed is not responsible
  or liable for the availability or accuracy of such Third-Party Services, or the content, products, or services available
  from such Third-Party Services. Links to such Third-Party Services are not an endorsement by FairlyWed of such Third-Party
  Services.</p>

<p>1.7 Due to the nature of the Internet, FairlyWed cannot guarantee the continuous and uninterrupted availability and accessibility
  of the FairlyWed Platform. FairlyWed may restrict the availability of the FairlyWed Platform or certain areas or features
  thereof, if this is necessary in view of capacity limits, the security or integrity of our servers, or to carry out maintenance
  measures that ensure the proper or improved functioning of the FairlyWed Platform. FairlyWed may improve, enhance and modify
  the FairlyWed Platform and introduce new FairlyWed Services from time to time.</p>

<h4>
  </a> 2. Eligibility, Using the FairlyWed Platform, Member Verification</h4>

<p>2.1 You must be at least 18 years old and able to enter into legally binding contracts to access and use the FairlyWed Platform
  or register a FairlyWed Account. By accessing or using the FairlyWed Platform you represent and warrant that you are 18
  or older and have the legal capacity and authority to enter into a contract.</p>

<p>2.2 You will comply with any applicable export control laws in your local jurisdiction. You also represent and warrant that
  (i) neither you nor your Vendor Service(s) are located or take place in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government
  embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a &quot;terrorist supporting&quot; country, and (ii) you
  are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.</p>

<p>2.3 FairlyWed may make the access to and use of the FairlyWed Platform, or certain areas or features of the FairlyWed Platform,
  subject to certain conditions or requirements, such as completing a verification process, meeting specific quality or eligibility
  criteria, meeting Ratings or Reviews thresholds, or booking and cancellation history.</p>

<p>2.4 User verification on the Internet is difficult and we do not assume any responsibility for the confirmation of any Member’s
  identity. Notwithstanding the above, for transparency and fraud prevention purposes, and as permitted by applicable laws,
  we may, but have no obligation to (i) ask Members to provide a form of government identification or other information or
  undertake additional checks designed to help verify the identities or backgrounds of Members, (ii) screen Members against
  third party databases or other sources and request reports from service providers, and (iii) where we have sufficient information
  to identify a Member, obtain reports from public records of criminal convictions or sex offender registrations or an equivalent
  version of background or registered sex offender checks in your local jurisdiction (if available).</p>

<p>2.5 The access to or use of certain areas and features of the FairlyWed Platform may be subject to separate policies, standards
  or guidelines, or may require that you accept additional terms and conditions. If there is a conflict between these Terms
  and terms and conditions applicable to a specific area or feature of the FairlyWed Platform, the latter terms and conditions
  will take precedence with respect to your access to or use of that area or feature, unless specified otherwise.</p>

<p>2.6 If you access or download the Application from the Apple App Store, you agree to <a href="http://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/appstore/dev/stdeula/">Apple’s Licensed Application End User License Agreement</a>.
  Some areas of the FairlyWed Platform implement Google Maps/Earth mapping services, including Google Maps API(s). Your use
  of Google Maps/Earth is subject to the <a href="https://www.google.com/help/terms_maps.html">Google Maps/Google Earth Additional Terms of Service</a>.</p>

<h4>
  </a> 3. Modification of these Terms</h4>

<p>FairlyWed reserves the right to modify these Terms at any time in accordance with this provision. If we make changes to these
  Terms, we will post the revised Terms on the FairlyWed Platform and update the “Last Updated” date at the top of these
  Terms. We will also provide you with notice of the modifications by email at least thirty (30) days before the date they
  become effective. If you disagree with the revised Terms, you may terminate this Agreement with immediate effect. We will
  inform you about your right to terminate the Agreement in the notification email. If you do not terminate your Agreement
  before the date the revised Terms become effective, your continued access to or use of the FairlyWed Platform will constitute
  acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>

<h4>
  </a> 4. Account Registration</h4>

<p>4.1 You must register an account (&quot;<strong>FairlyWed Account</strong>&quot;) to access and use certain features of the
  FairlyWed Platform, such as publishing or booking a Listing. If you are registering a FairlyWed Account for a company or
  other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to legally bind that entity and grant us all
  permissions and licenses provided in these Terms.</p>

<p>4.2 You can register a FairlyWed Account using an email address and creating a password, or through your account with certain
  third-party social networking services, such as Facebook or Google (&quot;<strong>SNS Account</strong>&quot;). You have
  the ability to disable the connection between your FairlyWed Account and your SNS Account at any time, by accessing the
  &quot;Settings&quot; section of the FairlyWed Platform.</p>

<p>4.3 You must provide accurate, current and complete information during the registration process and keep your FairlyWed Account
  and public FairlyWed Account profile page information up-to-date at all times.</p>

<p>4.4 You may not register more than one (1) FairlyWed Account unless FairlyWed authorizes you to do so. You may not assign
  or otherwise transfer your FairlyWed Account to another party.</p>

<p>4.5 You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your FairlyWed Account credentials and may not
  disclose your credentials to any third party. You must immediately notify FairlyWed if you know or have any reason to suspect
  that your credentials have been lost, stolen, misappropriated, or otherwise compromised or in case of any actual or suspected
  unauthorized use of your FairlyWed Account. You are liable for any and all activities conducted through your FairlyWed
  Account, unless such activities are not authorized by you and you are not otherwise negligent (such as failing to report
  the unauthorized use or loss of your credentials).</p>

<p>4.6 FairlyWed may enable features that allow you to authorize other Members or certain third parties to take certain actions
  that affect your FairlyWed Account. For example, we may allow Members associated with an Enterprise (as defined in our
  Privacy Policy) to book for other Members, or we may allow Vendors to add other Members as Co-Vendors (as defined below)
  to help manage their Listings. These features do not require that you share your credentials with any other person. No
  third party is authorized by FairlyWed to ask for your credentials, and you shall not request the credentials of another
  Member.</p>

<h4>
  </a> 5. Content</h4>

<p>5.1 FairlyWed may, at its sole discretion, enable Members to (i) create, upload, post, send, receive and store content, such
  as text, photos, audio, video, or other materials and information on or through the FairlyWed Platform (&quot;<strong>Member Content</strong>&quot;);
  and (ii) access and view Member Content and any content that FairlyWed itself makes available on or through the FairlyWed
  Platform, including proprietary FairlyWed content and any content licensed or authorized for use by or through FairlyWed
  from a third party (&quot;<strong>FairlyWed Content</strong>&quot; and together with Member Content, &quot;<strong>Collective Content</strong>&quot;).</p>

<p>5.2 The FairlyWed Platform, FairlyWed Content, and Member Content may in its entirety or in part be protected by copyright,
  trademark, and/or other laws of the United States and other countries. You acknowledge and agree that the FairlyWed Platform
  and FairlyWed Content, including all associated intellectual property rights, are the exclusive property of FairlyWed and/or
  its licensors or authorizing third-parties. You will not remove, alter or obscure any copyright, trademark, service mark
  or other proprietary rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the FairlyWed Platform, FairlyWed Content or Member
  Content. All trademarks, service marks, logos, trade names, and any other source identifiers of FairlyWed used on or in
  connection with the FairlyWed Platform and FairlyWed Content are trademarks or registered trademarks of FairlyWed in the
  United States and abroad. Trademarks, service marks, logos, trade names and any other proprietary designations of third
  parties used on or in connection with the FairlyWed Platform, FairlyWed Content, and/or Collective Content are used for
  identification purposes only and may be the property of their respective owners.</p>

<p>5.3 You will not use, copy, adapt, modify, prepare derivative works of, distribute, license, sell, transfer, publicly display,
  publicly perform, transmit, broadcast or otherwise exploit the FairlyWed Platform or Collective Content, except to the
  extent you are the legal owner of certain Member Content or as expressly permitted in these Terms. No licenses or rights
  are granted to you by implication or otherwise under any intellectual property rights owned or controlled by FairlyWed
  or its licensors, except for the licenses and rights expressly granted in these Terms.</p>

<p>5.4 Subject to your compliance with these Terms, FairlyWed grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, revocable,
  non-transferable license to (i) download and use the Application on your personal device(s); and (ii) access and view any
  Collective Content made available on or through the FairlyWed Platform and accessible to you, solely for your personal
  and non-commercial use.</p>

<p>5.5 By creating, uploading, posting, sending, receiving, storing, or otherwise making available any Member Content on or
  through the FairlyWed Platform, you grant to FairlyWed a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable, perpetual
  (or for the term of the protection), sub-licensable and transferable license to such Member Content to access, use, store,
  copy, modify, prepare derivative works of, distribute, publish, transmit, stream, broadcast, and otherwise exploit in any
  manner such Member Content to provide and/or promote the FairlyWed Platform, in any media or platform. Unless you provide
  specific consent, FairlyWed does not claim any ownership rights in any Member Content and nothing in these Terms will be
  deemed to restrict any rights that you may have to use or exploit your Member Content.</p>

<p>5.6 FairlyWed may offer Vendors the option of having professional photographers take photographs of their Vendor Services,
  which are made available by the photographer to Vendors to include in their Listings with or without a watermark or tag
  bearing the words &quot;FairlyWed.com Verified Photo&quot; or similar wording (&quot;<strong>Verified Images</strong>&quot;).
  You are responsible for ensuring that your Vendor Service is accurately represented in the Verified Images and you will
  stop using the Verified Images on or through the FairlyWed Platform if they no longer accurately represent your Listing,
  if you stop hosting the Vendor Service featured, or if your FairlyWed Account is terminated or suspended for any reason.
  You acknowledge and agree that FairlyWed shall have the right to use any Verified Images in advertising, marketing and/or
  any other business purposes in any media or platform, whether in relation to your Listing or otherwise, without further
  notice or compensation to you. Where FairlyWed is not the exclusive owner of Verified Images, by using such Verified Images
  on or through the FairlyWed Platform, you grant to FairlyWed an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable, perpetual
  (or for the term of the protection), sub-licensable and transferable license to use such Verified Images for advertising,
  marketing and/or any other business purposes in any media or platform, whether in relation to your Listing or otherwise,
  without further notice or compensation to you. FairlyWed in turn grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable,
  revocable, non-transferable license to use Verified Images outside of the FairlyWed Platform solely for your personal and
  non-commercial use.</p>

<p>5.7 You are solely responsible for all Member Content that you make available on or through the FairlyWed Platform. Accordingly,
  you represent and warrant that: (i) you either are the sole and exclusive owner of all Member Content that you make available
  on or through the FairlyWed Platform or you have all rights, licenses, consents and releases that are necessary to grant
  to FairlyWed the rights in and to such Member Content, as contemplated under these Terms; and (ii) neither the Member Content
  nor your posting, uploading, publication, submission or transmittal of the Member Content or FairlyWed's use of the Member
  Content (or any portion thereof) will infringe, misappropriate or violate a third party's patent, copyright, trademark,
  trade secret, moral rights or other proprietary or intellectual property rights, or rights of publicity or privacy, or
  result in the violation of any applicable law or regulation.</p>

<p>5.8 You will not post, upload, publish, submit or transmit any Member Content that: (i) is fraudulent, false, misleading
  (directly or by omission or failure to update information) or deceptive; (ii) is defamatory, libelous, obscene, pornographic,
  vulgar or offensive; (iii) promotes discrimination, bigotry, racism, hatred, harassment or harm against any individual
  or group; (iv) is violent or threatening or promotes violence or actions that are threatening to any other person; (v)
  promotes illegal or harmful activities or substances; or (vi) violates FairlyWed’s <a href="/help/article/546/what-is-FairlyWed-s-content-policy">Content Policy</a>  or any other FairlyWed policy. FairlyWed may, without prior notice, remove or disable access to any Member Content that
  FairlyWed finds to be in violation of these Terms or FairlyWed’s then-current <a href="/help/policies">Policies</a> or
  <a href="/standards">Standards</a>, or otherwise may be harmful or objectionable to FairlyWed, its Members, third parties,
  or property.</p>

<p>5.9 FairlyWed respects copyright law and expects its Members to do the same. If you believe that any content on the FairlyWed
  Platform infringes copyrights you own, please notify us in accordance with our <a href="/terms/copyright_policy">Copyright Policy</a>.</p>

<h4>
  </a> 6. Service Fees</h4>

<p>6.1 FairlyWed may charge fees to Vendors (&quot;<strong>Vendor Fees</strong>&quot;) and/or Guests (&quot;<strong>Guest Fees</strong>&quot;)
  (collectively, &quot;<strong>Service Fees</strong>&quot;) in consideration for the use of the FairlyWed Platform. More
  information about when Service Fees apply and how they are calculated can be found on our <a href="/help/article/1857/what-are-FairlyWed-service-fees">Service Fees page</a>.</p>

<p>6.2 Any applicable Service Fees (including any applicable Taxes) will be displayed to a Vendor or Guest prior to publishing
  or booking a Listing. FairlyWed reserves the right to change the Service Fees at any time, and we will provide Members
  adequate notice of any fee changes before they become effective.</p>

<p>6.3 You are responsible for paying any Service Fees that you owe to FairlyWed. The applicable Service Fees are due and payable
  and collected by FairlyWed Payments pursuant to the <a href="/terms/payments_terms">Payments Terms</a>. Except as otherwise
  provided on the FairlyWed Platform, Service Fees are non-refundable.</p>

<h4>
  </a> 7. Terms specific for Vendors</h4>

<h5>7.1 Terms applicable to all Listings</h5>

<p>7.1.1 When creating a Listing through the FairlyWed Platform you must (i) provide complete and accurate information about
  your Vendor Service (such as listing description, location, and calendar availability), (ii) disclose any deficiencies,
  restrictions (such as house rules) and requirements that apply (such as any minimum age, proficiency or fitness requirements
  for an Experience) and (iii) provide any other pertinent information requested by FairlyWed. You are responsible for keeping
  your Listing information (including calendar availability) up-to-date at all times.</p>

<p>7.1.2 You are solely responsible for setting a price (including any Taxes if applicable) for your Listing (“<strong>Listing Fee</strong>”).
  Once a Guest requests a booking of your Listing, you may not request that the Guest pays a higher price than in the booking
  request.</p>

<p>7.1.3 Any terms and conditions included in your Listing, in particular in relation to cancellations, must not conflict with
  these Terms or the cancellation policy you have selected for your Listing.</p>

<p>7.1.4 Pictures, animations or videos (collectively, &quot;<strong>Images</strong>&quot;) used in your Listings must accurately
  reflect the quality and condition of your Vendor Services. FairlyWed reserves the right to require that Listings have a
  minimum number of Images of a certain format, size and resolution.</p>

<p>7.1.5 The placement and ranking of Listings in search results on the FairlyWed Platform may vary and depend on a variety
  of factors, such as Guest search parameters and preferences, Vendor requirements, price and calendar availability, number
  and quality of Images, customer service and cancellation history, Reviews and Ratings, type of Vendor Service, and/or ease
  of booking.</p>

<p>7.1.6 When you accept or have pre-approved a booking request by a Guest, you are entering into a legally binding agreement
  with the Guest and are required to provide your Vendor Service(s) to the Guest as described in your Listing when the booking
  request is made. You also agree to pay the applicable Vendor Fee and any applicable Taxes, which will be collected pursuant
  to the <a href="/terms/payments_terms">Payments Terms</a>.</p>

<p>7.1.7 FairlyWed recommends that Vendors obtain appropriate insurance for their Vendor Services. Please review any respective
  insurance policy carefully, and in particular make sure that you are familiar with and understand any exclusions to, and
  any deductibles that may apply for, such insurance policy, including, but not limited to, whether or not your insurance
  policy will cover the actions or inactions of Guests (and the individuals the Guest has booked for, if applicable) while
  staying at your Accommodation or participating in your Experience, Event or other Vendor Service.</p>

<h5>7.2 Listing Accommodations</h5>

<p>7.2.1 You may only list one Accommodation per Listing.</p>

<p>7.2.2 If you choose to require a security deposit for your Accommodation, you must specify this in your Listing (&quot;<strong>Security Deposit</strong>&quot;).
  Vendors are not allowed to ask for a Security Deposit after a booking has been confirmed or outside of the FairlyWed Platform.
  FairlyWed will use commercially reasonable efforts to address Vendors’ requests and claims related to Security Deposits,
  but FairlyWed is not responsible for administering or accepting any claims by Vendors related to Security Deposits.</p>

<p>7.2.3 You represent and warrant that any Listing you post and the booking of, or a Guest's stay at, an Accommodation will
  (i) not breach any agreements you have entered into with any third parties, such as homeowners association, condominium,
  or other agreements, and (ii) comply with all applicable laws (such as zoning laws), Tax requirements, and other rules
  and regulations (including having all required permits, licenses and registrations). As a Vendor, you are responsible for
  your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of any individuals who reside at or are
  otherwise present at the Accommodation at your request or invitation, excluding the Guest (and the individuals the Guest
  invites to the Accommodation, if applicable).</p>

<h5>7.3 Listing Experiences, Events and other Vendor Services</h5>

<p>7.3.1 To list an Experience, Event or other Vendor Service, you must create a Listing and submit the Experience, Event or
  Vendor Service to FairlyWed. To be considered for publishing on the FairlyWed Platform, Experiences, Events or other Vendor
  Services must at all times meet the <a href="/help/topic/906/">quality standards for Experiences</a> and meet Guest demand.
  FairlyWed reserves the right to decide, in its sole discretion, if a submitted Experience, Event or other Vendor Service
  will be published on the FairlyWed Platform.</p>

<p>7.3.2 When listing an Experience, Event or other Vendor Service you must, where applicable, fully educate and inform Guests
  about (i) any risks inherent to the Experience, Event or other Vendor Service, (ii) any requirements for participation,
  such as the minimum age, related skills, level of fitness or other requirements, and (iii) anything else they may need
  to know to safely participate in the Experience, Event or other Vendor Service (including dress codes, equipment, special
  certifications or licenses, etc.).</p>

<p>7.3.3 If you wish to list an Experience on behalf of a Nonprofit (“Social Impact Experience”), you must comply with the
  <a
    href="/help/article/1578">eligibility requirements</a> for hosting a Social Impact Experience. When listing a Social Impact Experience you (i) represent
    and warrant that you are duly authorized to act on behalf of your Nonprofit and (ii) acknowledge and agree that all payouts
    will be directed to an account owned by your Nonprofit. You and your Nonprofit acknowledge that listing a Social Impact
    Experience does not create a commercial fundraising or co-venturer, or charitable trust relationship with FairlyWed and
    FairlyWed is not a professional fundraiser or commercial participator. Nonprofits, and not FairlyWed, are responsible
    for determining what, if any, portion of their Listing Fee is a charitable contribution and for providing Guests charitable
    tax receipts for any applicable charitable contributions. You and your Nonprofit are solely responsible for complying
    with all laws that apply to your organization and your Social Impact Experience.</p>

<p>7.3.4 You represent and warrant that you (i) understand and comply with all laws, rules and regulations that may apply to
  your Experience, Event or other Vendor Service(s), and (ii) will obtain any required licenses, permits, or registrations
  prior to providing your Experience, Event or other Vendor Service(s). You can find additional information about some of
  the legal obligations that may apply to you on our <a href="/help/topic/896/responsible-hosting">Responsible Vendoring</a>  pages.</p>

<p>7.3.5 You must provide an Experience, Event or other Vendor Service in person and may not allow any third party to provide
  the Experience, Event or other Vendor Service on your behalf, unless authorized by FairlyWed.</p>

<h5>7.4 Co-Vendors</h5>

<p>7.4.1 FairlyWed may enable Vendors to authorize other Members (“<strong>Co-Vendors</strong>”) to administer the Vendor’s
  Listing(s), and to bind the Vendor and take certain actions in relation to the Listing(s) as permitted by the Vendor, such
  as accepting booking requests, messaging and welcoming Guests, and updating the Listing Fee and calendar availability (collectively,
  “<strong>Co-Vendor Services</strong>”). Any agreement formed between Vendor and Co-Vendor may not conflict with these Terms
  and the <a href="/terms/payments_terms">Payments Terms</a>. Co-Vendors may only act in an individual capacity and not on
  behalf of a company or other organization, unless expressly authorized by FairlyWed. FairlyWed reserves the right, in our
  sole discretion, to limit the number of Co-Vendors a Vendor may invite for each Listing and to limit the number of Listings
  a Co-Vendor may manage.</p>

<p>7.4.2 Vendors and Co-Vendors may agree on a fee (“<strong>Co-Vendor Services Fee</strong>”) in consideration for the Co-Vendor
  Services provided by the Co-Vendor. When such an agreement is made, the Vendor agrees to pay the Co-Vendor Services Fee
  for any confirmed booking of their Listing, which will be deducted directly from the Listing Fee after deduction of any
  applicable Vendor Fee. In addition, Vendors may instruct a Co-Vendor to provide certain one-time services in relation to
  their Listing. Vendors can pay Co-Vendors for one-time services and any other expenses using the Resolution Center. FairlyWed
  Payments will process Co-Vendor Services Fees and Resolution Center payments pursuant to the <a href="/terms/payments_terms">Payments Terms</a>.</p>

<p>7.4.3 Vendors and Co-Vendors agree that each activity, booking, or other transaction reported on the FairlyWed Platform,
  including any Co-Vendor Services provided by the Co-Vendor and any amounts due from a Vendor to the Co-Vendor for the provision
  of such services, will be deemed accurate, correct and binding, unless challenged, by notifying the other person and FairlyWed
  (by emailing <a href="mailto:host-exp@FairlyWed.com">host-exp@FairlyWed.com</a>), within 21 days of posting of the disputed
  activity, booking or other transaction on the FairlyWed Platform.</p>

<p>7.4.4 Vendors should exercise due diligence and care when deciding who to add as a Co-Vendor to their Listing(s). Vendors
  remain solely responsible and liable for any and all Listings and Member Content published on the FairlyWed Platform, including
  any Listing created by a Co-Vendor on their behalf. Further, Vendors remain responsible and liable for their own acts and
  omissions, including, but not limited to, conduct that causes harm or damage to the Co-Vendor(s). Co-Vendors remain responsible
  and liable for their own acts and omissions when engaging in their roles and responsibilities as a Co-Vendor, including,
  but not limited to, conduct that causes harm or damage to the Vendor. In addition, both Vendor and Co-Vendor are jointly
  responsible and severally liable for third party claims, including Guest claims, arising from the acts and omissions of
  the other person as related to hosting activities, communications with Guests, and the provision of any Co-Vendor Services.</p>

<p>7.4.5 Unless agreed otherwise by Vendor and Co-Vendor, Vendor and Co-Vendor may terminate the Co-Vendor agreement at any
  time. In addition, both Vendor and Co-Vendor acknowledge that their Co-hosting relationship will terminate in the event
  that FairlyWed (i) terminates the Co-Vendor service or (ii) terminates either party’s participation in the Co-Vendor service.
  When the Co-Vendor agreement is terminated, the Vendor will remain responsible for all of the Co-Vendor’s actions prior
  to the termination, including the responsibility to fulfill any pending or future bookings initiated prior to the termination.
  When a Member is removed as a Co-Vendor, that Member will no longer have access to any Vendor or Guest information related
  to the applicable Vendor’s Listing(s). In addition, Vendor agrees to pay Co-Vendor for all Co-Vendor Services completed
  prior to Co-Vendor’s termination within 14 days of Co-Vendor’s termination via the Resolution Center. A Co-Vendor will
  not be entitled to any fees for any Co-Vendor Services that have not been completed prior to the Co-Vendor’s termination.</p>

<p>7.4.6 As a Co-Vendor, you will not be reviewed by Guests, meaning that your Co-Vendor activities will not affect your Reviews
  or Ratings for other Listings for which you are a Vendor. Instead, the Vendor of such Listing(s) will be reviewed by Guests
  (including potentially on the basis of the Co-Vendor’s conduct and performance). Vendors acknowledge that Reviews and Ratings
  from Guests for their Listing(s) may be impacted by a Co-Vendor’s conduct and performance.</p>

<h4>
  </a> 8. Terms specific for Guests</h4>

<h5>8.1 Terms applicable to all bookings</h5>

<p>8.1.1 Subject to meeting any requirements (such as completing any verification processes) set by the Vendor, you can book
  a Listing available on the FairlyWed Platform by following the respective booking process. All applicable fees, including
  the Listing Fee, Security Deposit (if applicable), Guest Fee and any applicable Taxes (collectively, “<strong>Total Fees</strong>”)
  will be presented to you prior to booking a Listing. You agree to pay the Total Fees for any booking requested in connection
  with your FairlyWed Account.</p>

<p>8.1.2 Upon receipt of a booking confirmation from FairlyWed, a legally binding agreement is formed between you and your Vendor,
  subject to any additional terms and conditions of the Vendor that apply, including in particular the applicable cancellation
  policy and any rules and restrictions specified in the Listing. FairlyWed Payments will collect the Total Fees at the time
  of the booking request or upon the Vendor’s confirmation pursuant to the <a href="/terms/payments_terms">Payments Terms</a>.</p>

<p>8.1.3 If you book a Vendor Service on behalf of additional clients, you are required to ensure that every additional client
  meets any requirements set by the Vendor, and is made aware of and agrees to these Terms and any terms and conditions,
  rules and restrictions set by the Vendor. If you are booking for an additional client who is a minor, you represent and
  warrant that you are legally authorized to act on behalf of the minor. Minors may only participate in an Experience, Event
  or other Vendor Service if accompanied by an adult who is responsible for them.</p>

<h5>8.2 Booking Accommodations</h5>

<p>8.2.1 You understand that a confirmed booking of an Accommodation (“<strong>Accommodation Booking</strong>”) is a limited
  license granted to you by the Vendor to enter, occupy and use the Accommodation for the duration of your stay, during which
  time the Vendor (only where and to the extent permitted by applicable law) retains the right to re-enter the Accommodation,
  in accordance with your agreement with the Vendor.</p>

<p>8.2.2 You agree to leave the Accommodation no later than the checkout time that the Vendor specifies in the Listing or such
  other time as mutually agreed upon between you and the Vendor. If you stay past the agreed upon checkout time without the
  Vendor's consent (“<strong>Overstay</strong>”), you no longer have a license to stay in the Accommodation and the Vendor
  is entitled to make you leave in a manner consistent with applicable law. In addition, you agree to pay, if requested by
  the Vendor, for each twenty-four (24) hour period (or any portion thereof) that you Overstay, an additional nightly fee
  of up to two (2) times the average nightly Listing Fee originally paid by you to cover the inconvenience suffered by the
  Vendor, plus all applicable Guest Fees, Taxes, and any legal expenses incurred by the Vendor to make you leave (collectively,
  &quot;<strong>Overstay Fees</strong>&quot;). Overstay Fees for late checkouts on the checkout date that do not impact upcoming
  bookings may be limited to the additional costs incurred by the Vendor as a result of such Overstay. FairlyWed Payments
  will collect Overstay Fees from you pursuant to the <a href="/terms/payments_terms">Payments Terms</a>. A Security Deposit,
  if required by a Vendor, may be applied to any Overstay Fees due for a Guest’s Overstay.</p>

<h5>8.3 Booking Experiences, Events and other Vendor Services</h5>

<p>8.3.1 You should carefully review the description of any Experience, Event or other Vendor Service you intend to book to
  ensure you (and any additional clients you are booking for) meet any minimum age, proficiency, fitness or other requirements
  which the Vendor has specified in their Listing. You are required to inform the Vendor of any medical or physical conditions,
  or other circumstances that may impact your and any additional client’s ability to safely participate in any Experience,
  Event or other Vendor Service. In addition, certain laws, like the minimum legal drinking age in the location of the Experience,
  Event or other Vendor Service, may also apply. You are responsible for identifying, understanding, and complying with all
  laws, rules and regulations that apply to your participation in an Experience, Event or other Vendor Service.</p>

<p>8.3.2 Before and during an Experience, Event or other Vendor Service you must at all times adhere to the Vendors’ instructions.</p>

<p>8.3.3 You may not bring any additional individuals to an Experience, Event or other Vendor Service unless such an individual
  was added by you as an additional client during the booking process on the FairlyWed Platform.</p>

<h4>
  </a> 9. Booking Modifications, Cancellations and Refunds, Resolution Center</h4>

<p>9.1 Vendors and Guests are responsible for any modifications to a booking that they make via the FairlyWed Platform or direct
  FairlyWed customer service to make (&quot;<strong>Booking Modifications</strong>&quot;), and agree to pay any additional
  Listing Fees, Vendor Fees or Guest Fees and/or Taxes associated with such Booking Modifications.</p>

<p>9.2 Guests can cancel a confirmed booking at any time subject to the Listing’s cancellation policy, and FairlyWed Payments
  will provide any refund to the Guest in accordance with such cancellation policy. Unless <a href="/help/article/1320/what-is-FairlyWed-s-extenuating-circumstances-policy">extenuating circumstances</a>  exist, any amounts due to the Vendor under the applicable cancellation policy will be remitted to the Vendor by FairlyWed
  Payments pursuant to the <a href="/terms/payments_terms">Payments Terms</a>.</p>

<p>9.3 If a Vendor cancels a confirmed booking, the Guest will receive a full refund of the Total Fees for such booking and
  FairlyWed may publish an automated review on the Listing cancelled by the Vendor indicating that a booking was cancelled.
  In addition, FairlyWed may (i) keep the calendar for the Listing unavailable or blocked for the dates of the cancelled
  booking, and/or (ii) impose a cancellation fee, unless the Vendor has a valid reason for cancelling the booking pursuant
  to <a href="/help/article/1320/what-is-FairlyWed-s-extenuating-circumstances-policy">FairlyWed’s Extenuating Circumstances Policy</a>  or has legitimate concerns about the Guest’s behavior.</p>

<p>9.4 For Experiences, Events and other Vendor Services, if inclement weather creates an unsafe or uncomfortable scenario for
  Guests, Vendors may modify or cancel a Vendor Service. If there is a substantial change in the itinerary or the Vendor
  Service needs to be cancelled, FairlyWed will work with the Vendor to provide Guests an alternative date for the Vendor
  Service, an appropriate refund or a rebooking.</p>

<p>9.5 In certain circumstances, FairlyWed may decide, in its sole discretion, that it is necessary to cancel a confirmed booking
  and make appropriate refund and payout decisions. This may be for reasons set forth in <a href="/help/article/1320/what-is-FairlyWed-s-extenuating-circumstances-policy">FairlyWed's Extenuating Circumstances Policy</a>  or (i) where FairlyWed believes in good faith, while taking the legitimate interests of both parties into account, this
  is necessary to avoid significant harm to FairlyWed, other Members, third parties or property, or (ii) for any of the reasons
  set out in these Terms.</p>

<p>9.6 If a Guest suffers a Travel Issue pursuant to the <a ui-sref="policies.refund">Guest Refund Policy</a>, FairlyWed may
  determine, in its sole discretion, to refund the Guest part or all of the Total Fees in accordance with the Guest Refund
  Policy.</p>

<p>9.7 Members may use the Resolution Center to send or request money for refunds, additional Vendor Services, Co-Vendor Services
  or Damage Claims related to bookings. You agree to pay all amounts sent through the Resolution Center in connection with
  your FairlyWed Account, and FairlyWed Payments will handle all such payments pursuant to the <a href="/terms/payments_terms">Payments Terms</a>.</p>

<h4>
  </a> 10. Ratings and Reviews</h4>

<p>10.1 Within a certain timeframe after completing a booking, Guests and Vendors can leave a public review (“<strong>Review</strong>”)
  and submit a star rating (“<strong>Rating</strong>”) about each other. Any Ratings or Reviews reflect the opinion of individual
  Members and do not reflect the opinion of FairlyWed. Ratings and Reviews are not verified by FairlyWed for accuracy and
  may be incorrect or misleading.</p>

<p>10.2 Ratings and Reviews by Guests and Vendors must be fair, truthful and factual and may not contain any offensive or defamatory
  language. Ratings and Reviews must comply with FairlyWed’s <a href="/help/article/546/what-is-FairlyWed-s-content-policy">Content Policy</a>  and <a href="/help/article/548/what-is-FairlyWed-s-extortion-policy">Extortion Policy</a>.</p>

<p>10.3 Members are prohibited from manipulating the Ratings and Reviews system in any manner, such as instructing a third party
  write a positive or negative Review about another Member.</p>

<h4>
  </a> 11. Damage to Accommodations, Disputes between Members</h4>

<p>11.1 As a Guest, you are responsible for leaving the Accommodation (including any personal or other property located at the
  Accommodation) in the condition it was in when you arrived. You are responsible for your own acts and omissions and are
  also responsible for the acts and omissions of any individuals whom you invite to, or otherwise provide access to, the
  Accommodation, excluding the Vendor (and the individuals the Vendor invites to the Accommodation, if applicable).</p>

<p>11.2 If a Vendor claims and provides evidence that you as a Guest have damaged an Accommodation or any personal or other
  property at an Accommodation (&quot;<strong>Damage Claim</strong>&quot;), the Vendor can seek payment from you through
  the Resolution Center. If a Vendor escalates a Damage Claim to FairlyWed, you will be given an opportunity to respond.
  If you agree to pay the Vendor, or FairlyWed determines in its sole discretion that you are responsible for the Damage
  Claim, FairlyWed Payments will collect any such sums from you and/or against the Security Deposit (if applicable) required
  to cover the Damage Claim pursuant to the <a href="/terms/payments_terms">Payments Terms</a>. FairlyWed also reserves the
  right to otherwise collect payment from you and pursue any remedies available to FairlyWed in this regard in situations
  in which you are responsible for a Damage Claim, including, but not limited to, in relation to any payment requests made
  by Vendors under the FairlyWed Vendor Guarantee.</p>

<p>11.3 Members agree to cooperate with and assist FairlyWed in good faith, and to provide FairlyWed with such information and
  take such actions as may be reasonably requested by FairlyWed, in connection with any Damage Claims or other complaints
  or claims made by Members relating to Accommodations or any personal or other property located at an Accommodation (including,
  without limitation, payment requests made under the FairlyWed Vendor Guarantee), Experiences, or Co-Vendor agreements.
  A Member shall, upon FairlyWed's reasonable request and at no cost to the Member, participate in mediation or a similar
  resolution process with another Member, which process will be conducted by FairlyWed or a third party selected by FairlyWed
  or its insurer, with respect to losses for which a Member is requesting payment from FairlyWed (including but not limited
  to payments under the FairlyWed Vendor Guarantee).</p>

<p>11.4 If you are a Guest or a Co-Vendor, you understand and agree that FairlyWed may make a claim under your homeowner's,
  renter's or other insurance policy related to any damage or loss that you may have caused, or been responsible for, to
  an Accommodation or any personal or other property located at an Accommodation (including without limitation amounts paid
  by FairlyWed under the FairlyWed Vendor Guarantee). You agree to cooperate with and assist FairlyWed in good faith, and
  to provide FairlyWed with such information as may be reasonably requested by FairlyWed, to make a claim under your homeowner's,
  renter's or other insurance policy, including, but not limited to, executing documents and taking such further acts as
  FairlyWed may reasonably request to assist FairlyWed in accomplishing the foregoing.</p>

<h4>
  </a> 12. Rounding off, Currency conversion</h4>

<p>12.1 FairlyWed may, in its sole discretion, round up or round down amounts that are payable from or to Guests or Vendors
  to the nearest whole functional base unit in which the currency is denominated (i.e. to the nearest dollar, euro or other
  supported currency); for example, FairlyWed will round up an amount of $101.50 to $102.00, and round down an amount of
  $101.49 to $101.00. For currencies that are denominated in large numbers, FairlyWed may determine the functional base unit
  in which those currencies are denominated to be 10, 100 or 1,000 of the currency; for example, FairlyWed may round up an
  amount of 1,045 up to 1,050 and 1,044 down to 1,040, or 837,500 up to 838,000 and 837,499 down to 837,000.</p>

<p>12.2 The FairlyWed Platform facilitates bookings between Guests and Vendors who may prefer to pay in a currency different
  from their destination currency, which may require currency conversions to accommodate these differing currency preferences.
  Although the FairlyWed Platform allows Members to view the price of Listings in a number of currencies, the currencies
  available for Members to make and receive payments may be limited, and may not include the default currency in any given
  geographic location. Details regarding currency conversion, including any associated fees, are detailed in the <a href="/terms/payments_terms">Payments Terms</a>.</p>

<h4>
  </a> 13. Taxes</h4>

<p>13.1 As a Vendor you are solely responsible for determining your obligations to report, collect, remit or include in your
  Listing Fees any applicable VAT or other indirect sales taxes, occupancy tax, tourist or other visitor taxes or income
  taxes (&quot;<strong>Taxes</strong>&quot;).</p>

<p>13.2 Tax regulations may require us to collect appropriate Tax information from Vendors, or to withhold Taxes from payouts
  to Vendors, or both. If a Vendor fails to provide us with documentation that we determine to be sufficient to alleviate
  our obligation (if any) to withhold Taxes from payouts to you, we reserve the right to freeze all payouts, withhold such
  amounts as required by law, or to do both, until resolution.</p>

<p>13.3 You understand that any appropriate governmental agency, department and/or authority (&quot;<strong>Tax Authority</strong>&quot;)
  where your Accommodation is located may require Taxes to be collected from Guests or Vendors on Listing Fees, and to be
  remitted to the respective Tax Authority. The laws in jurisdictions may vary, but these Taxes may be required to be collected
  and remitted as a percentage of the Listing Fees set by Vendors, a set amount per day, or other variations, and are sometimes
  called &quot;transient occupancy taxes,&quot; &quot;hotel taxes,&quot; &quot;lodging taxes,&quot; &quot;city taxes,&quot;
  &quot;room taxes&quot; or &quot;tourist taxes&quot; (&quot;<strong>Occupancy Taxes</strong>&quot;).</p>

<p>13.4 In certain jurisdictions, FairlyWed may decide in its sole discretion to facilitate collection and remittance of Occupancy
  Taxes from or on behalf of Guests or Vendors, in accordance these Terms (&quot;<strong>Collection and Remittance</strong>&quot;)
  if such jurisdiction asserts FairlyWed or Vendors have an Occupancy Tax collection and remittance obligation. In any jurisdiction
  in which we decide to facilitate direct Collection and Remittance, you hereby instruct and authorize FairlyWed (via FairlyWed
  Payments) to collect Occupancy Taxes from Guests on the Vendor's behalf at the time Listing Fees are collected, and to
  remit such Occupancy Taxes to the Tax Authority. The amount of Occupancy Taxes, if any, collected and remitted by FairlyWed
  will be visible to and separately stated to both Guests and Vendors on their respective transaction documents. Where FairlyWed
  is facilitating Collection and Remittance, Vendors are not permitted to collect any Occupancy Taxes being collected by
  FairlyWed relating to their Accommodations in that jurisdiction.</p>

<p>13.5 You agree that any claim or cause of action relating to FairlyWed's facilitation of Collection and Remittance of Occupancy
  Taxes shall not extend to any supplier or vendor that may be used by FairlyWed in connection with facilitation of Collection
  and Remittance, if any. Guests and Vendors agree that we may seek additional amounts from you in the event that the Taxes
  collected and/or remitted are insufficient to fully discharge your obligations to the Tax Authority, and agree that your
  sole remedy for Occupancy Taxes collected is a refund of Occupancy Taxes collected by FairlyWed from the applicable Tax
  Authority in accordance with applicable procedures set by that Tax Authority.</p>

<p>13.6 FairlyWed reserves the right, with prior notice to Vendors, to cease the Collection and Remittance in any jurisdiction
  for any reason at which point Vendors and Guests are once again solely responsible and liable for the collection and/or
  remittance of any and all Occupancy Taxes that may apply to Accommodations in that jurisdiction.</p>

</ul>

<p>14.2 You acknowledge that FairlyWed has no obligation to monitor the access to or use of the FairlyWed Platform by any Member
  or to review, disable access to, or edit any Member Content, but has the right to do so to (i) operate, secure and improve
  the FairlyWed Platform (including without limitation for fraud prevention, risk assessment, investigation and customer
  support purposes); (ii) ensure Members’ compliance with these Terms; (iii) comply with applicable law or the order or requirement
  of a court, law enforcement or other administrative agency or governmental body; (iv) respond to Member Content that it

  requested by FairlyWed with respect to any investigation undertaken by FairlyWed or a representative of FairlyWed regarding
  the use or abuse of the FairlyWed Platform.</p>

<p>14.3 If you feel that any Member you interact with, whether online or in person, is acting or has acted inappropriately,
  including but not limited to anyone who (i) engages in offensive, violent or sexually inappropriate behavior, (ii) you
  suspect of stealing from you, or (iii) engages in any other disturbing conduct, you should immediately report such person

<p>15.2 You may terminate this Agreement at any time via the &quot;Cancel Account&quot; feature on the FairlyWed Platform or

<p><strong>You agree that you have had whatever opportunity you deem necessary to investigate the FairlyWed Services, laws, rules, or regulations that may be applicable to your Listings and/or Vendor Services you are receiving and that you are not relying upon any statement of law or fact made by FairlyWed relating to a Listing.</strong></p>

<p><strong>If we choose to conduct identity verification or background checks on any Member, to the extent permitted by applicable law, we disclaim warranties of any kind, either express or implied, that such checks will identify prior misconduct by a Member or guarantee that a Member will not engage in misconduct in the future.</strong></p>

<p><strong>You agree that some Experiences, Events or other Vendor Services may carry inherent risk, and by participating in those Vendor Services, you choose to assume those risks voluntarily. For example, some Vendor Services may carry risk of illness, bodily injury, disability, or death, and you freely and willfully assume those risks by choosing to participate in those Vendor Services. You assume full responsibility for the choices you make before, during and after your participation in a Vendor Service. If you are bringing a minor as an additional client, you are solely responsible for the supervision of that minor throughout the duration of your Vendor Service and to the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to release and hold harmless FairlyWed from all liabilities and claims that arise in any way from any injury, death, loss or harm that occurs to that minor during the Vendor Service or in any way related to your Vendor Service.</strong></p>


<p><strong>The foregoing disclaimers apply to the maximum extent permitted by law. You may have other statutory rights. However, the duration of statutorily required warranties, if any, shall be limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.</strong></p>

<h4>
  </a> 17. Liability</h4>

<p><strong>17.1 Unless you reside in the EU, you acknowledge and agree that, to the maximum extent permitted by law, the entire risk arising out of your access to and use of the FairlyWed Platform and Collective Content, your publishing or booking of any Listing via the FairlyWed Platform, your stay at any Accommodation, participation in any Experience or Event or use of any other Vendor Service or any other interaction you have with other Members whether in person or online remains with you. Neither FairlyWed nor any other party involved in creating, producing, or delivering the FairlyWed Platform or Collective Content will be liable for any incidental, special, exemplary or consequential damages, including lost profits, loss of data or loss of goodwill, service interruption, computer damage or system failure or the cost of substitute products or services, or for any damages for personal or bodily injury or emotional distress arising out of or in connection with (i) these Terms, (ii) from the use of or inability to use the FairlyWed Platform or Collective Content, (iii) from any communications, interactions or meetings with other Members or other persons with whom you communicate, interact or meet with as a result of your use of the FairlyWed Platform, or (iv) from your publishing or booking of a Listing, including the provision or use of a Listing’s Vendor Services, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence), product liability or any other legal theory, and whether or not FairlyWed has been informed of the possibility of such damage, even if a limited remedy set forth herein is found to have failed of its essential purpose. Except for our obligations to pay amounts to applicable Vendors pursuant to these Terms or an approved payment request under the FairlyWed Vendor Guarantee, in no event will FairlyWed’s aggregate liability arising out of or in connection with these Terms and your use of the FairlyWed Platform including, but not limited to, from your publishing or booking of any Listings via the FairlyWed Platform, or from the use of or inability to use the FairlyWed Platform or Collective Content and in connection with any Accommodation, Experiences, Event or other Vendor Service, or interactions with any other Members, exceed the amounts you have paid or owe for bookings via the FairlyWed Platform as a Guest in the twelve (12) month period prior to the event giving rise to the liability, or if you are a Vendor, the amounts paid by FairlyWed to you in the twelve (12) month period prior to the event giving rise to the liability, or one hundred U.S. dollars (US$100), if no such payments have been made, as applicable. The limitations of damages set forth above are fundamental elements of the basis of the bargain between FairlyWed and you. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so the above limitation may not apply to you. If you reside outside of the U.S., this does not affect FairlyWed’s liability for death or personal injury arising from its negligence, nor for fraudulent misrepresentation, misrepresentation as to a fundamental matter or any other liability which cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law.</strong></p>

<p><strong>17.2 If you reside in the EU, FairlyWed is liable under statutory provisions for intent and gross negligence by us, our legal representatives, directors, or other vicarious agents. The same applies to the assumption of guarantees or any other strict liability, or in case of a culpable injury to life, limb, or health. FairlyWed is liable for any negligent breaches of essential contractual obligations by us, our legal representatives, directors, or other vicarious agents. Essential contractual obligations are such duties of FairlyWed in whose proper fulfilment you regularly trust and must trust for the proper execution of the contract but the amount shall be limited to the typically occurring foreseeable damage. Any additional liability of FairlyWed is excluded.</strong></p>

<h4>
  </a> 18. Indemnification</h4>

<p>You agree to release, defend (at FairlyWed’s option), indemnify, and hold FairlyWed and its affiliates and subsidiaries,
  and their officers, directors, employees and agents, harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses,
  and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees, arising out of or in any way connected
  with (i) your breach of these Terms or our Policies or Standards, (ii) your improper use of the FairlyWed Platform or any
  FairlyWed Services, (iii) your interaction with any Member, stay at an Accommodation, participation in an Experience, Event
  or other Vendor Service, including without limitation any injuries, losses or damages (whether compensatory, direct, incidental,
  consequential or otherwise) of any kind arising in connection with or as a result of such interaction, stay, participation
  or use, (iv) FairlyWed’s Collection and Remittance of Occupancy Taxes, or (v) your breach of any laws, regulations or third
  party rights.</p>

<h4>
  </a> 19. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Agreement</h4>

<p>19.1 This Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Agreement shall apply if you (i) reside in the United States; or (ii) do not
  reside in the United States, but bring any claim against FairlyWed in the United States (to the extent not in conflict
  with Section 21).</p>

<p>19.2 <em>Overview of Dispute Resolution Process</em>. FairlyWed is committed to participating in a consumer-friendly dispute
  resolution process. To that end, these Terms provide for a two-part process for individuals to whom Section 19.1 applies:
  (1) an informal negotiation directly with FairlyWed’s customer service team, and (2) a binding arbitration administered
  by the American Arbitration Association (“<strong>AAA</strong>”) using its specially designed Consumer Arbitration Rules
  (as modified by this Section 19). Specifically, the process provides:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Claims can be filed with AAA online (<a href="http://www.adr.org/" target="_blank">www.adr.org</a>);</li>
  <li>Arbitrators must be neutral and no party may unilaterally select an arbitrator;</li>
  <li>Arbitrators must disclose any bias, interest in the result of the arbitration, or relationship with any party;</li>
  <li>Parties retain the right to seek relief in small claims court for certain claims, at their option;</li>
  <li>The initial filing fee for the consumer is capped at $200;</li>
  <li>The consumer gets to elect the hearing location and can elect to participate live, by phone, video conference, or, for
    claims under $25,000, by the submission of documents;</li>
  <li>The arbitrator can grant any remedy that the parties could have received in court to resolve the party’s individual claim.</li>
</ul>

<p>19.3 <em>Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution and Notification</em>. Prior to initiating an arbitration, you and FairlyWed
  each agree to notify the other party of the dispute and attempt to negotiate an informal resolution to it first. We will
  contact you at the email address you have provided to us; you can contact FairlyWed’s customer service team by <a href="mailto:terms@FairlyWed.com">emailing us</a>.
  If after a good faith effort to negotiate one of us feels the dispute has not and cannot be resolved informally, the party
  intending to pursue arbitration agrees to notify the other party via email prior to initiating the arbitration. In order
  to initiate arbitration, a claim must be filed with the AAA and the written Demand for Arbitration (available at <a href="https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Demand%20for%20Arbitration%20Consumer%20Arbitration%20Rules.pdf"
    target="_blank">www.adr.org</a>) provided to the other party, as specified in the AAA Rules.</p>

<p><strong>19.4 <em>Agreement to Arbitrate</em>. You and FairlyWed mutually agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement or interpretation thereof, or to the use of the FairlyWed Platform, the Vendor Services, or the Collective Content (collectively, “Disputes”) will be settled by binding arbitration (the “Arbitration Agreement”). If there is a dispute about whether this Arbitration Agreement can be enforced or applies to our Dispute, you and FairlyWed agree that the arbitrator will decide that issue.</strong></p>

<p>19.5 <em>Exceptions to Arbitration Agreement</em>. You and FairlyWed each agree that the following claims are exceptions
  to the Arbitration Agreement and will be brought in a judicial proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction: (i) Any
  claim related to actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks,
  trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights; (ii) Any claim seeking emergency injunctive relief based
  on exigent circumstances (e.g., imminent danger or commission of a crime, hacking, cyber-attack).</p>

<p>19.6 <em>Arbitration Rules and Governing Law</em>. This Arbitration Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce
  and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. The arbitration will
  be administered by AAA in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “<strong>AAA Rules</strong>“) then in effect,
  except as modified here. The AAA Rules are available at <a href="http://www.adr.org/" target="_blank">www.adr.org</a> or
  by calling the AAA at 1–800–778–7879.</p>

<p>19.7 <em>Modification to AAA Rules - Arbitration Hearing/Location</em>. In order to make the arbitration most convenient
  to you, FairlyWed agrees that any required arbitration hearing may be conducted, at your option, (a) in the county where
  you reside; (b) in San Francisco County; (c) in any other location to which you and FairlyWed both agree; (d) via phone
  or video conference; or (e) for any claim or counterclaim under $25,000, by solely the submission of documents to the arbitrator.</p>

<p>19.8 <em>Modification of AAA Rules - Attorney’s Fees and Costs</em>. You may be entitled to seek an award of attorney fees
  and expenses if you prevail in arbitration, to the extent provided under applicable law and the AAA rules. Unless the arbitrator
  determines that your claim was frivolous or filed for the purpose of harassment, FairlyWed agrees it will not seek, and
  hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law or the AAA rules, to recover attorneys’ fees and expenses if
  it prevails in arbitration.</p>

<p>19.9 <em>Arbitrator’s Decision</em>. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which
  the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court with proper jurisdiction.
  The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only on an individual basis and only to the extent necessary
  to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim.</p>

<p><strong>19.10 <em>Jury Trial Waiver</em>. You and FairlyWed acknowledge and agree that we are each waiving the right to a trial by jury as to all arbitrable Disputes.</strong></p>

<p><strong>19.11 <em>No Class Actions or Representative Proceedings</em>. You and FairlyWed acknowledge and agree that we are each waiving the right to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action lawsuit, class-wide arbitration, private attorney-general action, or any other representative proceeding as to all Disputes. Further, unless you and FairlyWed both otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one party’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this paragraph is held unenforceable with respect to any Dispute, then the entirety of the Arbitration Agreement will be deemed void with respect to such Dispute.</strong></p>

<p>19.12 <em>Severability</em>. Except as provided in Section 19.11, in the event that any portion of this Arbitration Agreement
  is deemed illegal or unenforceable, such provision shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall
  be given full force and effect.</p>

<p>19.13 <em>Changes</em>. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3 (“Modification of these Terms”), if FairlyWed changes
  this Section 19 (“Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Agreement”) after the date you last accepted these Terms (or accepted
  any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email)
  within thirty (30) days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Last Updated” date above or in the
  date of FairlyWed’s email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will
  arbitrate any Dispute between you and FairlyWed in accordance with the provisions of the “Dispute Resolution and Arbitration
  Agreement” section as of the date you last accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).</p>

<p>19.14 <em>Survival</em>. Except as provided in Section 19.12 and subject to Section 15.8, this Section 19 will survive any
  termination of these Terms and will continue to apply even if you stop using the FairlyWed Platform or terminate your FairlyWed
  Account.</p>

<h4>
  </a> 20. Feedback</h4>

<p>We welcome and encourage you to provide feedback, comments and suggestions for improvements to the FairlyWed Platform (“<strong>Feedback</strong>“).
  You may submit Feedback by emailing us, through the <a href="/help/contact_us">“Contact”</a> section of the FairlyWed Platform,
  or by other means of communication. Any Feedback you submit to us will be considered non-confidential and non-proprietary
  to you. By submitting Feedback to us, you grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable, sub-licensable,
  perpetual license to use and publish those ideas and materials for any purpose, without compensation to you.</p>

<h4>
  </a> 21. Applicable Law and Jurisdiction</h4>

<p>21.1 If you reside in the United States, these Terms will be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California
  and the United States of America, without regard to conflict-of-law provisions. Judicial proceedings (other than small
  claims actions) that are excluded from the Arbitration Agreement in Section 19 must be brought in state or federal court
  in San Francisco, California, unless we both agree to some other location. You and we both consent to venue and personal
  jurisdiction in San Francisco, California.</p>

<p>21.2 If you reside in China these Terms will be interpreted in accordance with the laws of China (“<strong>China Laws</strong>”).
  Any dispute arising from or in connection with this Agreement shall be submitted to the China International Economic and
  Trade Arbitration Commission (CIETAC) for arbitration in Beijing which shall be conducted in accordance with CIETAC’s arbitration
  rules in effect at the time of applying for arbitration, provided that this section shall not be construed to limit any
  rights which FairlyWed may have to apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for an order requiring you to perform or
  be prohibited from performing certain acts and other provisional relief permitted under China Laws or any other laws that
  may apply to you. The arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in English. The arbitral award rendered is final and binding
  upon both parties.</p>

<p>21.3 If you reside outside of the United States and China, these Terms will be interpreted in accordance with Irish law.
  The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) is excluded. The
  choice of law does not impact your rights as a consumer according to the consumer protection regulations of your country
  of residence. If you are acting as a consumer, you agree to submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the Irish courts.
  Judicial proceedings that you are able to bring against us arising from or in connection with these Terms may only be brought
  in a court located in Ireland or a court with jurisdiction in your place of residence. If FairlyWed wishes to enforce any
  of its rights against you as a consumer, we may do so only in the courts of the jurisdiction in which you are a resident.
  If you are acting as a business, you agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Irish courts.</p>

<h4>
  </a> 22. General Provisions</h4>

<p>22.1 Except as they may be supplemented by additional terms and conditions, policies, guidelines or standards, these Terms
  constitute the entire Agreement between FairlyWed and you pertaining to the subject matter hereof, and supersede any and
  all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between FairlyWed and you in relation to the access to and use of

<p>22.2 No joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and FairlyWed as a result of this
  Agreement or your use of the FairlyWed Platform.</p>

<p>22.3 These Terms do not and are not intended to confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than the parties.</p>

<p>22.4 If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision will be struck and will not affect
  the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions.</p>

<p>22.5 FairlyWed’s failure to enforce any right or provision in these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision
  unless acknowledged and agreed to by us in writing. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either
  party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise
  permitted under law.</p>

<p>22.6 You may not assign, transfer or delegate this Agreement and your rights and obligations hereunder without FairlyWed's
  prior written consent. FairlyWed may without restriction assign, transfer or delegate this Agreement and any rights and
  obligations hereunder, at its sole discretion, with 30 days prior notice. Your right to terminate this Agreement at any
  time remains unaffected.</p>

<p>22.7 Unless specified otherwise, any notices or other communications to Members permitted or required under this Agreement,
  will be in writing and given by FairlyWed via email, FairlyWed Platform notification, or messaging service (including SMS
  and WeChat). For notices made to Members residing outside of Germany, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which

    <p><strong>How the Site, Application and Services Work</strong></p>

    <p>The Site, Application and Services can be used to facilitate the listing and Booking of <strong>Accommodations</strong>.
      Such Accommodations are included in Listings on the Site, Application and Services by Vendors. You may view Listings
      as an unregistered visitor to the Site, Application and Services; however, if you wish to book an Accommodation or
      create a Listing, you must first register to create a FairlyWed Account (defined below).</p>

    <p>As stated above, FairlyWed makes available an online platform or marketplace with related technology for Guests and Vendors
      to meet online and arrange for Bookings of Accommodations directly with each other. FairlyWed is not an owner or operator
      of properties, including, but not limited to, hotel rooms, motel rooms, other lodgings or Accommodations, nor is it
      a provider of properties, including, but not limited to, hotel rooms, motel rooms, other lodgings or Accommodations
      and FairlyWed does not own, sell, resell, furnish, provide, rent, re-rent, manage and/or control properties, including,
      but not limited to, hotel rooms, motel rooms, other lodgings or Accommodations or transportation or travel services.
      Unless explicitly specified otherwise in the FairlyWed platform, FairlyWed’s responsibilities are limited to facilitating
      the availability of the Site, Application and Services.</p>

    <p>PLEASE NOTE THAT, AS STATED ABOVE, THE SITE, APPLICATION AND SERVICES ARE INTENDED TO BE USED TO FACILITATE HOSTS AND
      GUESTS CONNECTING AND BOOKING ACCOMMODATIONS DIRECTLY WITH EACH OTHER. FairlyWed CANNOT AND DOES NOT CONTROL THE CONTENT
      CONTAINED IN ANY LISTINGS AND THE CONDITION, LEGALITY OR SUITABILITY OF ANY ACCOMMODATIONS. FairlyWed IS NOT RESPONSIBLE
      FOR AND DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL LIABILITY RELATED TO ANY AND ALL LISTINGS AND ACCOMMODATIONS. ACCORDINGLY, ANY BOOKINGS
      WILL BE MADE OR ACCEPTED AT THE MEMBER’S OWN RISK.</p>

    <p><strong>Account Registration</strong></p>

    <p>In order to access certain features of the Site and Application, and to book an Accommodation or create a Listing, you
      must register to create an account (“<strong>FairlyWed Account</strong>“) and become a Member. You may register to
      join the Services directly via the Site or Application or as described in this section.</p>

    <p>You can also register to join by logging into your account with certain third-party social networking sites (“<strong>SNS</strong>“)
      (including, but not limited to, Facebook; each such account, a “<strong>Third-Party Account</strong>“), via our Site
      or Application, as described below. As part of the functionality of the Site, Application and Services, you may link
      your FairlyWed Account with Third-Party Accounts, by either: (i) providing your Third-Party Account login information
      to FairlyWed through the Site, Services or Application; or (ii) allowing FairlyWed to access your Third-Party Account,
      as permitted under the applicable terms and conditions that govern your use of each Third-Party Account. You represent
      that you are entitled to disclose your Third-Party Account login information to FairlyWed and/or grant FairlyWed access
      to your Third-Party Account (including, but not limited to, for use for the purposes described herein), without breach
      by you of any of the terms and conditions that govern your use of the applicable Third-Party Account and without obligating
      FairlyWed to pay any fees or making FairlyWed subject to any usage limitations imposed by such third-party service
      providers. By granting FairlyWed access to any Third-Party Accounts, you understand that FairlyWed will access, make
      available and store (if applicable) any Content that you have provided to and stored in your Third-Party Account (“<strong>SNS Content</strong>“)
      so that it is available on and through the Site, Services and Application via your FairlyWed Account and FairlyWed
      Account profile page. Unless otherwise specified in these Terms, all SNS Content, if any, will be considered to be
      Member Content for all purposes of these Terms. Depending on the Third-Party Accounts you choose and subject to the
      privacy settings that you have set in such Third-Party Accounts, personally identifiable information that you post
      to your Third-Party Accounts will be available on and through your FairlyWed Account on the Site, Services and Application.
      Please note that if a Third-Party Account or associated service becomes unavailable or FairlyWed’s access to such Third-Party
      Account is terminated by the third-party service provider, then SNS Content will no longer be available on and through
      the Site, Services and Application. You have the ability to disable the connection between your FairlyWed Account and
      your Third-Party Accounts, at any time, by accessing the “Settings” section of the Site and Application. PLEASE NOTE
      THAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR THIRD-PARTY ACCOUNTS IS GOVERNED
      SOLELY BY YOUR AGREEMENT(S) WITH SUCH THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS. FairlyWed makes no effort to review any SNS Content
      for any purpose, including but not limited to for accuracy, legality or non-infringement and FairlyWed is not responsible
      for any SNS Content.</p>

    <p>Your FairlyWed Account and your FairlyWed Account profile page will be created for your use of the Site and Application
      based upon the personal information you provide to us or that we obtain via an SNS as described above. You may not
      have more than one (1) active FairlyWed Account. You agree to provide accurate, current and complete information during
      the registration process and to update such information to keep it accurate, current and complete. FairlyWed reserves
      the right to suspend or terminate your FairlyWed Account and your access to the Site, Application and Services if you
      create more than one (1) FairlyWed Account, or if any information provided during the registration process or thereafter
      proves to be inaccurate, fraudulent, not current, incomplete, or otherwise in violation of these Terms of Service.</p>

    <p>You are responsible for safeguarding your password. You agree that you will not disclose your password to any third party.</p>

    <p>Unless expressly authorized by a specific feature on FairlyWed, you are not permitted to share your FairlyWed Account
      with anyone or allow others to access or use your FairlyWed Account. FairlyWed may enable features, in our discretion,
      that allow other Members to take certain actions associated with your FairlyWed Account, on your behalf with your express
      authorization, such as having your executive assistant, travel agent, or employer book on your behalf or adding a family
      member to your account as an additional Vendor. You agree that you will take sole responsibility for any activities
      or actions under your FairlyWed Account, whether or not you have authorized such activities or actions. You will immediately
      notify FairlyWed of any unauthorized use of your FairlyWed Account.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Accommodation Listings</strong></p>

    <p>As a Member, you may create Listings. To create a Listing, you will be asked a variety of questions about the Accommodation
      to be listed, including, but not limited to, the location, capacity, size, features, and availability of the Accommodation
      and pricing and related rules and financial terms. In order to be featured in Listings via the Site, Application and
      Services, all Accommodations must have valid physical addresses. Listings will be made publicly available via the Site,
      Application and Services. You understand and agree that the placement or ranking of Listings in search results may
      depend on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, Guest and Vendor preferences, ratings and/or ease of
      Booking.</p>

    <p>Other Members will be able to book your Accommodation via the Site, Application and Services based upon the information
      provided in your Listing, your Guest requirements, and Guests’ search parameters and preferences. You understand and
      agree that once a Guest requests a Booking of your Accommodation, you may not request the Guest to pay a higher price
      than in the Booking request.</p>

    <p>You acknowledge and agree that you alone are responsible for any and all Listings and Member Content you post. Accordingly,
      you represent and warrant that any Listing you post and the Booking of, or a Guest’s stay at, an Accommodation in a
      Listing you post (i) will not breach any agreements you have entered into with any third parties, such as homeowners
      association, condominium, or other third party agreements, and (ii) will (a) be in compliance with all applicable laws
      (such as zoning laws), Tax requirements, Intellectual Property laws, and rules and regulations that may apply to any
      Accommodation included in a Listing you post (including having all required permits, licenses and registrations), and
      (b) not conflict with the rights of third parties. Please note that FairlyWed assumes no responsibility for a Vendor’s
      compliance with any agreements with or duties to third parties, applicable laws, rules and regulations. FairlyWed reserves
      the right, at any time and without prior notice, to remove or disable access to any Listing for any reason, including
      Listings that FairlyWed, in its sole discretion, considers to be objectionable for any reason, in violation of these
      Terms or FairlyWed’s then-current <a href="/help/policies"><em>Policies and Community Guidelines</em></a> or <a href="/standards"><em>Standards</em></a>,
      <a href="/terms/trademark_and_branding"><em>Trademark &amp; Branding Guidelines</em></a>, or otherwise harmful to the
      Site, Application or Services.</p>

    <p>If you are a Vendor, you understand and agree that FairlyWed does not act as an insurer or as your contracting agent.
      If a Guest requests a Booking of your Accommodation and stays at your Accommodation, any agreement you enter into with
      such Guest is between you and the Guest and FairlyWed is not a party to it.</p>

    <p>When you create a Listing, you may also choose to include certain requirements which must be met by the Members who are
      eligible to request a Booking of your Accommodation, such as requiring Members to have a profile picture or verified
      phone number, in order to book your Accommodation. Any Member wishing to book Accommodations included in Listings with
      such requirements must meet these requirements. More information on how to set such requirements is available via the
      “Vendoring” section of the Site, Application and Services.</p>

    <p>If you are a Vendor, FairlyWed makes certain tools available to you to help you to make informed decisions about which
      Members you choose to confirm or preapprove for Booking for your Accommodation. You acknowledge and agree that, as
      a Vendor, you are responsible for your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of
      any individuals who reside at or are otherwise present at the Accommodation at your request or invitation, excluding
      the Guest (and the individuals the Guest invites to the Accommodation, if applicable.)</p>

    <p>FairlyWed recommends that Vendors obtain appropriate insurance for their Accommodations. Please review any insurance
      policy that you may have for your Accommodation carefully, and in particular please make sure that you are familiar
      with and understand any exclusions to, and any deductibles that may apply for, such insurance policy, including, but
      not limited to, whether or not your insurance policy will cover the actions or inactions of or relating to Guests (and
      the individuals the Guest invites to the Accommodation, if applicable) while at your Accommodation. Please also review
      such policy for any interaction with the FairlyWed Vendor Protection Insurance Program, to the extent provided in your
      jurisdiction.</p>

    <p>FairlyWed may offer Vendors the option of having photographers take photographs of their Accommodations. If you as a
      Vendor choose to have photographer do this, FairlyWed shall own all copyrights in photographs taken but these photographs
      will be made available to you to include in your Listing with a watermark or tag bearing the words “FairlyWed.com Verified
      Photo” or similar wording (“<strong>Verified Images</strong>“). You agree that you alone are responsible for ensuring
      that your Listing is accurately represented in the Verified Images. You alone are responsible for using the Verified
      Images for your Listing and you warrant that you will cease to use the Verified Images or any other images if such
      images cease to accurately represent your Listing or if you cease to be a Vendor for the Listing featured. All images,
      materials and content created by these photographers, including Verified Images, constitute FairlyWed Content, regardless
      of whether you include them in your Listing and you agree not to use them except in your Listing without prior authorization
      from FairlyWed. If your FairlyWed Account is terminated or suspended for any reason, you shall not use Verified Images
      in any way. You agree that FairlyWed retains its right to and may use the Verified Images for advertising, marketing,
      commercial and other business purposes in any media or platform, whether in relation to your Listing or otherwise,
      without further notice or compensation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>No Endorsement</strong></p>

    <p>FairlyWed does not endorse any Member, Listing or Accommodation. You understand that Verified Images are intended only
      to indicate a photographic representation of the Accommodation at the time the photograph was taken. Verified Images
      are therefore not an endorsement by FairlyWed of any Member, Listing or Accommodation.</p>

    <p>Members are required by these Terms to provide accurate information. Although FairlyWed may, for transparency or fraud
      prevention or detection purposes, directly or through third parties, ask you to provide a form of government identification,
      your date of birth, and other information, or undertake additional checks and processes designed to help verify or
      check the identities or backgrounds of Members and/or screen Member information against third party databases or other
      sources, we do not make any representations about, confirm, or endorse any Member or the Member’s purported identity
      or background.</p>

    <p>By registering for a FairlyWed Account, you agree that FairlyWed may - but is not obligated to - request a consumer report
      on you from a Consumer Reporting Agency. If we do request a consumer report, we’ll request and use it in compliance
      with applicable law, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act.</p>

    <p>Any references in the Site, Application or Services to a Member being “verified” or “connected” (or similar language)
      only indicate that the Member has completed a relevant verification or identification process, and does not represent
      anything else. Any such description is not an endorsement, certification or guarantee by FairlyWed about any Member,
      including of the Member’s identity and whether the Member is trustworthy, safe or suitable. Instead, any such description
      is intended to be useful information for you to evaluate when you make your own decisions about the identity and suitability
      of others whom you contact or interact with via the Site, Application and Services. We therefore recommend that you
      always exercise due diligence and care when deciding whether to stay with a Vendor or to accept or preapprove a Booking
      request from a Guest, or to have any other interaction with any other Member. Except as provided in the FairlyWed
      <a
        href="/terms/host_guarantee"><em>Vendor Guarantee Terms and Conditions</em></a> (“<strong>FairlyWed Vendor Guarantee</strong>“), which is an agreement
        between FairlyWed and Vendors, we are not responsible for any damage or harm resulting from your interactions with
        other Members.</p>

    <p>By using the Site, Application or Services, you agree that any legal remedy or liability that you seek to obtain for
      actions or omissions of other Members or other third parties will be limited to a claim against the particular Members
      or other third parties who caused you harm. You agree not to attempt to impose liability on or seek any legal remedy
      from FairlyWed with respect to such actions or omissions. Accordingly, we encourage you to communicate directly with
      other Members on the Site and Services regarding any Bookings or Listings made by you. This limitation shall not apply
      to any claim by a Vendor against FairlyWed regarding the remittance of payments received from a Guest by FairlyWed
      on behalf of a Vendor, which instead shall be subject to the limitations described in the section below entitled “Limitation
      of Liability”.</p>

        <p><em>Key definitions</em></p>

        <p>“<strong>Accommodation Fees</strong>” means the amounts that are due and payable by a Guest in exchange for that
          Guest’s stay in an Accommodation. The Vendor alone, and not FairlyWed, is responsible for the Accommodation Fees
          for his or her Listing. The Vendor may in his or her sole discretion decide to include in these amounts (i) a cleaning
          fee or any other fee permitted on the FairlyWed platform, or (ii) Taxes that the Vendor determines that he or she
          has to collect.</p>

        <p>“<strong>Guest Fees</strong>” means the fee that FairlyWed charges a Guest for the use of the Services, which is
          calculated as a percentage of the applicable Accommodation Fees. The Guest Fees will be displayed to the Guest
          when the Guest is asked whether to send a Booking request to a Vendor.</p>

        <p>“<strong>Vendor Fees</strong>” means the fee that FairlyWed charges a Vendor for the use of the Services, which is
          calculated as a percentage of the applicable Accommodation Fees.</p>

        <p>“<strong>Payment Method</strong>” means a payment method that you have added to your FairlyWed Account, such as a
          credit card, debit card or PayPal.</p>

        <p>“<strong>Service Fees</strong>” means collectively the Guest Fees and the Vendor Fees.</p>

        <p>“<strong>Total Fees</strong>” means collectively the Accommodation Fees and the Guest Fees plus any Taxes.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><em>Bookings and Financial Terms for Vendors</em></p>

        <p>If you are a Vendor and a Booking is requested for your Accommodation via the Site, Application or Services, you
          will be required to either preapprove, confirm or reject the Booking request within the Booking Request Period,
          otherwise the Booking request will automatically expire. When a Booking is requested via the Site, Application
          or Services, we will share with you (i) the first and last name of the Guest who has requested the Booking, (ii)
          a link to the Guest’s FairlyWed Account profile page, (iii) if the Guest and Vendor have both connected their FairlyWed
          accounts to SNS and have not turned off sharing of social connections, the names of any shared connections on such
          SNS, and (iv) an indication of whether or not the Guest has provided other information to FairlyWed, such as a
          verified email address, connection to SNSs, or a government ID. If you are unable to confirm or decide to reject
          a Booking request within the Booking Request Period, any amounts collected by FairlyWed (via FairlyWed Payments)
          for the requested Booking will be refunded to the applicable Guest. When you confirm a Booking requested by a Guest,
          FairlyWed will send you a Communication confirming such Booking, depending on the selections you make via the Site,
          Application and Services.</p>

        <p>FairlyWed Payments will collect the Total Fees from Guests at the time of the Booking request or upon the Vendor’s
          confirmation and will initiate payment of the Accommodation Fees (less applicable fees and taxes) to the Vendor
          at the time and as further described in the <a href="/terms/payments_terms"><em>Payments Terms</em></a>.</p>

        <p>Each Vendor agrees that FairlyWed may, in accordance with the cancellation policy selected by the Vendor and reflected
          in the relevant Listing, (i) permit the Guest to cancel the Booking and (ii) refund (via FairlyWed Payments) to
          the Guest that portion of the Accommodation Fees specified in the applicable cancellation policy.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><em>Bookings and Financial Terms for Guests</em></p>

        <p>The Vendors, not FairlyWed, are solely responsible for honoring any confirmed Bookings and making available any Accommodations
          reserved through the Site, Application and Services. If you, as a Guest, choose to enter into a transaction with
          a Vendor for the Booking of an Accommodation, you agree and understand that you will be required to enter into
          an agreement with the Vendor and you agree to accept any terms, conditions, rules and restrictions associated with
          such Accommodation imposed by the Vendor.</p>

        <p>You acknowledge and agree that you, and not FairlyWed, will be responsible for performing the obligations of any
          such agreements, that FairlyWed is not a party to such agreements, and that, with the exception of FairlyWed Payments’
          obligations pursuant to the <a href="/terms/payments_terms"><em>Payments Terms</em></a>, FairlyWed (inclusive of
          all subsidiaries) disclaims all liability arising from or related to any such agreements.</p>

        <p>The Total Fees payable will be displayed to a Guest before the Guest sends a Booking request to a Vendor. As noted
          above, the Vendor is required to either preapprove, confirm or reject the Booking request within the Booking Request
          Period; otherwise, the requested Booking will be automatically cancelled. Upon receipt of your Booking request,
          FairlyWed Payments may initiate a pre-authorization and/or charge a nominal amount to your Payment Method pursuant
          to the <a href="/terms/payments_terms"><em>Payments Terms</em></a>. If a requested Booking is cancelled (i.e. not
          confirmed by the applicable Vendor), any amounts collected by FairlyWed Payments will be refunded to such Guest,
          depending on the selections the Guest makes via the Site and Application, and any pre-authorization of such Guest’s
          Payment Method will be released, if applicable.</p>

        <p>You as a Guest agree to pay the Total Fees for any Booking requested, and in most cases confirmed, in connection
          with your FairlyWed Account. FairlyWed Payments will collect the Total Fees pursuant to the <a href="/terms/payments_terms"><em>Payments Terms</em></a>.</p>

        <p>Once your confirmed Booking transaction is complete you will receive a confirmation Communication summarizing your
          confirmed Booking.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><em>Service Fees and Other Fees</em></p>

        <p>In consideration for the use of FairlyWed’s online marketplace and platform, FairlyWed charges Service Fees. FairlyWed
          Payments collects these Service Fees pursuant to the <a href="/terms/payments_terms"><em>Payments Terms</em></a>,
          and, where applicable, may also collect Taxes (such as VAT in Europe) in respect of the Vendor Fees and Guest Fees.
          FairlyWed Payments deducts the Vendor Fees from the Accommodation Fees before remitting the balance to the Vendor
          as described in the <a href="/terms/payments_terms"><em>Payments Terms</em></a>. Guest Fees are, as noted above,
          included in the Total Fees.</p>

        <p>Applicable Guest Fees, as well as Taxes collected by FairlyWed, will be shown to Guests via the Site and Application
          at checkout, prior to their submission of a Booking request. And, FairlyWed will disclose applicable Vendor Fees
          to Vendors via the Site and Application. More information on Services Fees can be found at the <a href="/help/article/384/what-are-the-service-fees"><strong>FairlyWed Help Center</strong></a>.</p>

        <p><em>General Booking and Financial Terms</em></p>

        <p><em>Cancellations and Refunds</em></p>

        <p>If, as a Guest, you wish to cancel a confirmed Booking made via the Site, Application and Services, either prior
          to or after arriving at the Accommodation, the cancellation policy of the Vendor contained in the applicable Listing
          will apply to such cancellation. Our ability to refund the Accommodation Fees, Guest Fees and other amounts charged
          to you will depend upon the terms of the applicable cancellation policy. Details regarding refunds and cancellation
          policies are available via the Site and Application. The Guest Fee is non-refundable unless otherwise indicated
          in the cancellation policy selected by the Vendor. FairlyWed Payments will initiate any refunds due pursuant to
          the <em><a href="/terms/payments_terms">Payments Terms</a>.</em></p>

        <p>If a Vendor cancels a confirmed Booking made via the Site, Services, and Application, (i) FairlyWed Payments will
          refund the Total Fees for such Booking to the applicable Guest pursuant to the <a href="/terms/payments_terms"><em>Payments Terms</em></a>          and (ii) the Guest will receive a Communication from FairlyWed containing alternative Listings and other related
          information. If the Guest requests a Booking from one of the alternative Listings and the Vendor associated with
          such alternative Listing confirms the Guest’s requested Booking, then the Guest agrees to pay FairlyWed the Total
          Fees relating to the confirmed Booking for the Accommodation in the alternative Listing, in accordance with these
          Terms. If a Vendor cancelled a confirmed Booking and you, as a Guest, have not received a Communication from FairlyWed,
          please <a href="/help/contact_us"><em>contact FairlyWed</em></a>.</p>

        <p>If, as a Vendor, you cancel a confirmed Booking, you agree that FairlyWed may apply penalties or consequences to
          you or your Listing, including (i) publishing an automated review on your Listing indicating that a Booking was
          cancelled, (ii) keeping the calendar for your Listing unavailable or blocked for the dates of the cancelled Booking,
          or (iii) imposing a cancellation fee. You will be notified of the situations in which a cancellation fee applies
          before you decide to cancel.</p>

        <p>In certain circumstances, FairlyWed may decide, in its sole discretion, that it is necessary or desirable to cancel
          a confirmed Booking made via the Site, Application and Services. This may be for reasons set forth in <a href="/help/article/934/what-extenuating-circumstances-are-eligible-for-a-refund?cref=50600db5c"><em>FairlyWed’s Extenuating Circumstances Policy</em></a>          or for any other reason. FairlyWed may also determine, in its sole discretion, to refund to the Guest part or all
          of the amounts charged to the Guest in accordance with the <a ui-sref="policies.refund"><em>Guest Refund Policy</em></a>          <a ui-sref="policies.refund">or in connection with a cancellation under</a> <a href="/help/article/934/what-extenuating-circumstances-are-eligible-for-a-refund?cref=50600db5c"><em>FairlyWed’s Extenuating Circumstances Policy</em></a>.
          You agree that FairlyWed and the relevant Guest or Vendor will not have any liability for such cancellations or
          refunds.</p>

        <p><em>Resolution Center</em></p>

        <p>Members may use the Resolution Center to send or request money for refunds, services or damages related to their
          Bookings. You agree to pay all amounts sent through the Resolution Center in connection with your FairlyWed Account,
          and FairlyWed Payments will handle all such payments pursuant to the <a href="/terms/payments_terms"><em>Payments Terms</em></a>.
          When a Member agrees to provide services or amenities to another Member via the Resolution Center, both parties
          acknowledge and agree that they, and not FairlyWed, will be responsible for performing their respective obligations
          of any such agreements, that FairlyWed is not a party to such agreements, and that, with the exception of FairlyWed
          Payments’ obligations pursuant to the <a href="/terms/payments_terms"><em>Payments Terms</em></a>, FairlyWed (inclusive
          of all subsidiaries) disclaims all liability arising from or related to any such agreements and the services or
          amenities provided.</p>

        <p><em>Rounding Off</em></p>

        <p>FairlyWed may, in its sole discretion, round up or round down amounts that are payable from or to Guests or Vendors
          to the nearest whole functional base unit in which the currency is denominated (e.g. to the nearest dollar, euro
          or other supported currency); for example, FairlyWed will round up an amount of
          <script type="math/tex">101.49 to </script>101.00.</p>

        <p>Some currencies are denominated in large numbers. In those cases, FairlyWed may determine the functional base unit
          in which those currencies are denominated to be 10, 100 or 1,000 of the currency; the corresponding examples for
          such currencies would be for FairlyWed to round up an amount of 1,045 up to 1,050 and 1,044 down to 1,040, or 35,450
          up to 35,500 and 35,449 down to 35,400, or 837,500 up to 838,000 and 837,499 down to 837,000.</p>

        <p><em>Donations</em></p>

        <p>Some Vendors may pledge to donate a portion of the funds they receive from confirmed Bookings made via the Site,
          Application and Services to aparticular cause or charity. We do not take any responsibility orliability for whether
          the Vendor does in fact make the donation he or shepledged to make. In such cases, the Vendor in question is responsible
          forhis or her own compliance with all laws and regulations applicable tosuch pledges and/or fund-raising.</p>

        <p><em>Booking Modifications</em></p>

        <p>You as a Guest or Vendor are responsible for any modifications to a Booking that you direct FairlyWed Customer Service
          to make (“<strong>Booking Modifications</strong>“), and you agree to pay any Accommodation Fees, Guest Fees, Vendors
          Fees, Services Fees, and/or Taxes associated with such Booking Modifications.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Taxes</strong></p>

    <p>Tax regulations may require us to collect appropriate tax information from our Vendors, or to withhold taxes from payouts
      to Vendors, or both. For instance, IRS regulations stipulate that we must collect an IRS Form W–9 from certain US Vendors,
      and an appropriate IRS Form W–8 (e.g. Form W–8BEN) from non-US hosts with at least one Listing in the US. You as a
      Vendor are solely responsible for keeping the information in your tax forms current, complete and accurate. If you
      as a Vendor fail to provide us with documentation that we determine to be sufficient to alleviate our obligation (if
      any) to withhold taxes from payments to you (e.g. where you are a US Vendor and you fail to provide us with a completed
      IRS Form W–9), we reserve the right in our sole discretion to freeze all payouts to you until resolution, to withhold
      such amounts as required by law, or to do both.</p>

    <p>You as a Vendor understand and agree that you are solely responsible for determining (i) your applicable Tax reporting
      requirements, and (ii) the Taxes that should be included, and for including Taxes to be collected or obligations relating
      to applicable Taxes in Listings. You are also solely responsible for remitting to the relevant authority any Taxes
      included or received by you. FairlyWed cannot and does not offer Tax-related advice to any Members.</p>

    <p>Where applicable, or based upon request from a Vendor, FairlyWed may issue a valid VAT invoice to such Vendor.</p>

    <p>You understand and acknowledge that appropriate governmental agencies, departments or authorities (the “<strong>Tax Authority</strong>“)
      where your Accommodation is located may require Taxes to be collected from Guests or Vendors on the amount paid for
      the right to use and/or occupancy of accommodations, and to be remitted to the respective Tax Authority. The laws in
      jurisdictions may vary, but these taxes may be required to be collected and remitted as a percentage of the Accommodation
      Fees set by Vendors, a set amount per day, or other variations, and are sometimes called “occupancy taxes,” “hotel
      taxes,” “lodging taxes,” “transient taxes,” “sales and use taxes,” “value added taxes,” “room taxes” or “tourist taxes”
      (hereafter, “<strong>Occupancy Taxes</strong>“).</p>

      <li>
        <p><em>Occupancy Tax Collection and Remittance</em></p>

        <p>In certain jurisdictions, FairlyWed may decide in its sole discretion to facilitate collection and remittance of
          Occupancy Taxes from or on behalf of Guests or Vendors, in accordance with your directions in these Terms (“Collection
          and Remittance”) if such tax jurisdiction asserts FairlyWed or Vendors have a tax collection and remittance obligation.
          In any jurisdiction in which we decide to facilitate direct Collection and Remittance, whether you are a Guest
          or Vendor, in lieu of the Vendor collecting Occupancy taxes from Guests and remitting to the Tax Authority, you
          hereby instruct and authorize FairlyWed (via FairlyWed Payments) to collect Occupancy Taxes from Guests on the
          Vendor’s behalf at the time Accommodation Fees are collected, and to remit such Occupancy Taxes to the Tax Authority.
          When FairlyWed facilitates Collection and Remittance of Occupancy Taxes in a jurisdiction for the first time, FairlyWed
          will provide notice to existing Vendors with Listings for Accommodations in such jurisdictions. When a new Listing
          is created in a jurisdiction where FairlyWed facilitates Collection and Remittance of Occupancy Taxes, the Vendor
          will be notified in the Listing creation flow.</p>

        <p>The amount of Occupancy Taxes, if any, collected and remitted by FairlyWed will be visible to and separately stated
          to both Guests and Vendors on their respective transaction documents. Where FairlyWed is directly facilitating
          Collection and Remittance, Guests and Vendors agree that Vendors are not permitted to attempt collection, or collect
          any Occupancy Taxes being collected by FairlyWed relating to their Accommodations on FairlyWed in that such jurisdiction.
          You expressly agree to release, defend, indemnify, and hold FairlyWed and its affiliates and subsidiaries, and
          their officers, directors, employees and agents, harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses,
          debts, obligations, and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and/or accounting fees, arising
          out of or in any way related to Occupancy Taxes, including, without limitation, the applicability of, calculation,
          collection or remittance of Occupancy Taxes in any amount or at all as to your transactions or Accommodations.
          For any jurisdiction in which we facilitate Collection and Remittance, Vendors and Guests expressly grant us permission,
          without further notice, to store, transfer and disclose data and other information relating to them or to their
          transactions, Bookings, Accommodations and Occupancy Taxes, including, but not limited to, personally identifiable
          information such as Vendor or Guest’s name, Listing addresses, transaction dates and amounts, tax identification
          number(s), the amount of taxes collected from Guests or allegedly due, contact information and similar information,
          to the relevant Tax Authority.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><em>Opt-in to Vendor Remittance of Taxes</em></p>

        <p>In other jurisdictions, FairlyWed may decide in its sole discretion to facilitate Occupancy Tax collection on behalf
          of Vendors and Guests in accordance with a Vendor’s direction to opt in to a specific Occupancy Tax line item in
          the Booking process, in which the Vendor directs that Occupancy Taxes from Guests be sent directly to the Vendor
          so that the Vendor will remit such taxes directly to Tax Authority (“<strong>Opt-in for Vendor Remittance</strong>“).
          In any jurisdiction in which we decide to facilitate Collection by Opt-in for Vendor Remittance, whether you are
          a Guest or Vendor, you hereby instruct and authorize FairlyWed (via FairlyWed Payments) to send Occupancy Taxes
          received from Guests at the time Accommodation Fees are collected to the Vendor who is obligated to send such taxes
          to the Tax Authority directly. If FairlyWed offers and a Vendor selects Opt-in for Vendor Remittance in any jurisdiction,
          Vendors and Guests remain solely responsible and liable for the payment and remittance of any and all taxes that
          may apply to Accommodations; you agree and understand that FairlyWed is not responsible for, and will not send
          any such Occupancy Taxes to the Tax Authority under Opt-in to Vendor Remittance of Taxes. You hereby agree that
          through third party payment processors, FairlyWed is merely processing Your election and direction to have Occupancy
          Taxes from Guests sent directly to the Vendor for remittance by the Vendor to the Tax Authority, and that You will
          remit all amounts collected from Guests as Occupancy Taxes to such Tax Authority. You expressly agree to release,
          defend, indemnify, and hold FairlyWed and its affiliates and subsidiaries, and their officers, directors, employees
          and agents, harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, debts, obligations, and expenses,
          including, without limitation, reasonable legal and/or accounting fees, arising out of or in any way related to
          Occupancy Taxes, including, without limitation, the applicability of, calculation of, collection of Occupancy Taxes
          in any amount or at all as to your transactions or Accommodations. For any jurisdiction in which we facilitate
          Opt-in for Vendor Remittance, Vendors and Guests expressly grant us permission, without further notice, to store,
          transfer and disclose data and other information relating to them or to their transactions, Bookings, Accommodations
          and Occupancy Taxes, including, but not limited to, personally identifiable information such as Vendor or Guest’s
          name, Listing addresses, transaction dates and amounts, tax identification number(s), the amount of taxes received
          by Vendors from Guests, or allegedly due, contact information and similar information, to the relevant Tax Authority.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><em>Miscellaneous Occupancy Tax Provisions</em></p>

        <p>Whether you are a Guest or Vendor, you agree that any claim or cause of action relating to FairlyWed’s facilitation
          of Opt-in for Vendor Remittance or Collection and Remittance of Occupancy Taxes shall not extend to any supplier
          or vendor that may be used by FairlyWed in connection with facilitation of Opt-in Remittance or Collection and
          Remittance of Occupancy Taxes, if any. Guests and Vendors agree that we may seek additional amounts from You in
          the event that the Taxes collected and/or remitted are insufficient to fully discharge your obligations to the
          Tax Authority, and agree that your sole remedy for Occupancy Taxes collected is a refund of Occupancy Taxes collected
          by FairlyWed from the applicable Tax Authority in accordance with applicable procedures set by that Tax Authority.</p>

        <p>In any jurisdiction in which we have not provided notice of, or are not facilitating (or are no longer facilitating)
          the collection or remittance of Occupancy Taxes by Collection and Remittance, Opt-in for Vendor Remittance or any
          other means or method, in your jurisdiction, Vendors and Guests remain solely responsible and liable for the collection
          and/or remittance of any and all Occupancy Taxes that may apply to Accommodations.</p>

        <p>Vendors and Guests acknowledge and agree that in some jurisdictions, FairlyWed may decide not to facilitate collection
          or remittance of Occupancy Taxes or may not be able to facilitate the collection and/or remittance of Occupancy
          Taxes, and nothing contained in these Terms of Service is a representation or guarantee that FairlyWed will facilitate
          collection and/or remittance of Occupancy Tax anywhere at all, including in any specific jurisdiction, or that
          FairlyWed will continue to facilitate any collection or remittance of Occupancy Tax in any specific jurisdiction
          in which it may have been offered. FairlyWed reserves the right, in its sole determination, to cease any facilitation
          of any collection and remittance of Occupancy Tax (regardless of method used or to be used in the future) for any
          reason or no reason at all, provided that it will give Vendors reasonable notice in any jurisdiction in which FairlyWed
          determines to cease any such facilitation.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Currency Conversion</strong></p>

    <p>FairlyWed’s online platform facilitates Bookings between Guests and Vendors who may pay in a currency different from
      their destination currency, which may require currency conversions to accommodate these differing currency preferences.
      Although the FairlyWed platform allows users to view the price of Listings in a number of currencies, the currencies
      available for users to make and receive payments may be limited, and may not include the default currency in any given
      geographic location.</p>

    <p>Details regarding currency conversion, including any associated fees, are detailed in the <a href="/terms/payments_terms"><em>Payments Terms</em></a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Damage to Accommodations and Security Deposits</strong></p>

    <p>As a Guest, you are responsible for leaving the Accommodation (including any personal or other property located at an
      Accommodation) in the condition it was in when you arrived. You acknowledge and agree that, as a Guest, you are responsible
      for your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of any individuals whom you invite
      to, or otherwise provide access to, the Accommodation. In the event that a Vendor claims otherwise and provides evidence
      of damage (“<strong>Damage Claim</strong>“), including but not limited to photographs, you agree to pay the cost of
      replacing the damaged items with equivalent items.</p>

    <p>Vendors may choose to include security deposits in their Listings (“<strong>Security Deposits</strong>“). Each Listing
      will describe whether a Security Deposit is required for the applicable Accommodation. FairlyWed will use commercially
      reasonable efforts to address Vendors’ requests and claims related to Security Deposits, but FairlyWed is not responsible
      for administering or accepting any Damage Claims by Vendors related to Security Deposits, and disclaims any and all
      liability in this regard.</p>

    <p>If a Vendor has a Damage Claim for a confirmed Booking, the Vendor can seek payment from the Guest through the Resolution
      Center. The Vendor may escalate the Damage Claim to FairlyWed if the Vendor and Guest are unable to resolve a Damage
      Claim through the Resolution Center, or immediately in certain circumstances. If a Vendor escalates a Damage Claim
      to FairlyWed, you as a Guest will be notified of the Damage Claim and given an opportunity to respond. If you as a
      Guest agree to pay the Vendor in connection with a Damage Claim, or if FairlyWed determines, in its sole discretion,
      that you are responsible for damaging an Accommodation or any personal or other property located at an Accommodation,
      FairlyWed (via FairlyWed Payments) will collect any such costs from you and/or against the Security Deposit in accordance
      with the <a href="/terms/payments_terms"><em>Payments Terms</em></a>. FairlyWed also reserves the right to otherwise
      collect payment from you and pursue any avenues available to FairlyWed in this regard in situations in which you have
      been determined, in FairlyWed’s sole discretion, to have damaged any Accommodation or any personal or other property
      located at an Accommodation.</p>

    <p>Both Guests and Vendors agree to cooperate with and assist FairlyWed in good faith, and to provide FairlyWed with such
      information and take such actions as may be reasonably requested by FairlyWed, in connection with any Damage Claims
      or other complaints or claims made by Members relating to Accommodations or any personal or other property located
      at an Accommodation (including, without limitation, payment requests made under the FairlyWed Vendor Guarantee) or
      with respect to any investigation undertaken by FairlyWed or a representative of FairlyWed regarding use or abuse of
      the Site, Application or the Services. If you are a Guest, upon FairlyWed’s reasonable request, and to the extent you
      are reasonably able to do so, you agree to participate in mediation or similar resolution process with a Vendor, at
      no cost to you, which process will be conducted by FairlyWed or a third party selected by FairlyWed or its insurer,
      with respect to losses for which the Vendor is requesting payment from FairlyWed under the FairlyWed Vendor Guarantee.</p>

    <p>If you are a Guest, you understand and agree that FairlyWed may make a claim under your homeowner’s, renter’s or other
      insurance policy related to any damage or loss that you may have caused or been responsible for or to an Accommodation
      or any personal or other property located at an Accommodation (including without limitation amounts paid by FairlyWed
      under the FairlyWed Vendor Guarantee). You agree to cooperate with and assist FairlyWed in good faith, and to provide
      FairlyWed with such information as may be reasonably requested by FairlyWed, in order to make a claim under your homeowner’s,
      renter’s or other insurance policy, including, but not limited to, executing documents and taking such further acts
      as FairlyWed may reasonably request to assist FairlyWed in accomplishing the foregoing.</p>

    <p>Security Deposits, if required by a Vendor, may be applied to any fees due from a Guest overstaying at a Listing without
      the Vendor’s consent.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Overstaying without the Vendor’s Consent</strong></p>

    <p>Guests agree that a confirmed Booking is merely a license granted by the Vendor to the Guest to enter and use the Listing
      for the limited duration of the confirmed Booking and in accordance with the Guest’s agreement with the Vendor. Guests
      further agree to leave the Accommodation no later than the checkout time that the Vendor specifies in the Listing or
      such other time as mutually agreed upon between the Vendor and Guest. If a Guest stays past the agreed upon checkout
      time without the Vendor’s consent, they no longer have a license to stay in the Listing and the Vendor is entitled
      to make the Guest leave. In addition, Guests agree that the Vendor can charge the Guest, for each 24 hour period that
      the Guest stays over the agreed period without the Vendor’s consent, an additional nightly fee of two times the average
      nightly Accommodation Fee originally paid by the Guest to cover the inconvenience suffered by the Vendor, plus all
      applicable Service Fees, Taxes, and any legal expenses incurred by the Vendor to make the Guest leave (collectively,
      “<strong>Additional Sums</strong>“). FairlyWed Payments will collect Additional Sums from Guests pursuant to the
      <a

          breaches and receiving poor ratings from Vendors or Guests, or (ii) FairlyWed believes in good faith that such
          action is reasonably necessary to protect the safety or property of Members, FairlyWed or third parties, for fraud
          prevention, risk assessment, security or investigation purposes.</p>

        <p>If we take any of the measures described in this Section 24.C, we may (i) communicate to your Guests or Vendors that

    <p><strong>Controlling Law and Jurisdiction</strong></p>

    <p>These Terms and your use of the Services will be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California and
      the United States of America, without regard to its conflict-of-law provisions. You and we agree to submit to the personal
      jurisdiction of a state court located in San Francisco County, San Francisco, California or a United States District
      Court, Northern District of California located in San Francisco, California for any actions for which the parties <strong>retain the right to seek</strong>      injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement,
      misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property
      rights, <strong>as set forth in the Dispute Resolution provision below.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Dispute Resolution</strong></p>

    <p>If you reside in the United States, you and FairlyWed agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or
      relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, or to the use
      of the Services or use of the Site, Application or Collective Content (collectively, “<strong>Disputes</strong>“) will
      be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief
      in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation
      of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights. You acknowledge
      and agree that you and FairlyWed are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or
      class member in any purported class action lawsuit, class-wide arbitration, private attorney-general action, or any
      other representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and FairlyWed otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator
      may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative
      proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this “Dispute Resolution” section
      will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this “Dispute Resolution” section will survive any
      termination of these Terms.</p>

    <p><em>Arbitration Rules and Governing Law</em>. This agreement to arbitrate evidences a transaction in interstate commerce,
      and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. The arbitration
      will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“<strong>AAA</strong>“) in accordance with the Consumer
      Arbitration Rules (the “<strong>AAA Rules</strong>“) then in effect, except as modified by this “Dispute Resolution”
      section. (The AAA Rules are available at <a href="http://www.adr.org/arb_med"><em>www.adr.org/arb_med</em></a>or by
      calling the AAA at 1–800–778–7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this
      section.</p>

    <p><em>Arbitration Process</em>. A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written
      Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a <a href="http://www.adr.org/cs/idcplg?IdcService=GET_FILE&amp;dDocName=ADRSTAGE2034889&amp;RevisionSelectionMethod=LatestReleased"><em>form Demand for Arbitration</em></a>.)
      The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of California and
      will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the parties are unable to
      agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint
      the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.</p>

    <p><em>Arbitration Location and Procedure</em>. Unless you and FairlyWed otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted
      in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed <span>$</span>10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted
      solely on the basis of documents you and FairlyWed submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator
      determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds <span>$</span>10,000, your right to a hearing will be
      determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable
      exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.</p>

    <p><em>Arbitrator’s Decision</em>. The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules.
      The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award.
      Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator’s award damages
      must be consistent with the terms of the “Limitation of Liability” section above as to the types and the amounts of
      damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor
      of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. If
      you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided
      under applicable law. FairlyWed will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover,
      attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.</p>

    <p><em>Fees</em>. Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth
      in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed <span>$</span>75,000, FairlyWed will pay all such
      fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration
      was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil
      Procedure 11(b)).</p>

    <p><em>Changes</em>. Notwithstanding the provisions of the “Modification” section above, if FairlyWed changes this “Dispute
      Resolution” section after the date you last accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms),
      you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email) within 30 days of the date such change
      became effective, as indicated in the “Last Updated” date above or in the date of FairlyWed’s email to you notifying
      you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and FairlyWed
      in accordance with the provisions of this “Dispute Resolution” section as of the date you last accepted these Terms
      (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>General</strong></p>

    <p>The failure of FairlyWed to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement
      of that right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed
      by a duly authorized representative of FairlyWed. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either
      party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or
      otherwise. If for any reason an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms
      invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions
      of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p>
