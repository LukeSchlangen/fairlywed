<h1>Terms of Service</h1>

<p>Last Updated: September 10, 2017</p>

<p>Please read these Terms of Service carefully as they contain important information about your legal rights, remedies and
  obligations. By accessing or using the FairlyWed Platform, you agree to comply with and be bound by these Terms of Service.</p>

<p>Thank you for using FairlyWed!</p>

<p>These Terms of Service (&quot;<strong>Terms</strong>&quot;) constitute a legally binding agreement (&quot;<strong>Agreement</strong>&quot;)
  between you and FairlyWed (as defined below) governing your access to and use of the FairlyWed website, including any subdomains
  thereof, and any other websites through which FairlyWed makes the FairlyWed Services available (collectively, &quot;<strong>Site</strong>&quot;),
  our mobile, tablet and other smart device applications, and application program interfaces (collectively, &quot;<strong>Application</strong>&quot;)
  and all associated services (collectively, &quot;<strong>FairlyWed Services</strong>&quot;). The Site, Application and
  FairlyWed Services together are hereinafter collectively referred to as the “<strong>FairlyWed Platform</strong>”. Our
  <a ui-sref="policies.contracts">Client-Photographer Contracts</a>, <a ui-sref="policies.cookie">Cookie Policy</a>,
  <a ui-sref="policies.copyright">Copyright Policy</a>, <a ui-sref="policies.nondiscrimination">Nondiscrimination Policy</a>,
  and <a ui-sref="policies.privacy">Privacy Policy</a> are incorporated by reference into this Agreement.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Vendors alone are responsible for identifying, understanding, and complying with all laws, rules and regulations that apply
    to their Vendor Services. For example, in many cities, Vendors may have to register, get a permit or obtain a license
    before preparing food or serving alcohol for sale. Some cities may require insurance to photograph a wedding. Vendors
    are alone responsible for identifying and obtaining any required licenses, permits, or registrations for any Vendor Services
    they offer. Certain types of Vendor Services may be prohibited altogether. Penalties may include fines or other enforcement.
    If you have questions about how local laws apply to your Listing(s) and Vendor Service(s) on FairlyWed, you should always
    seek legal guidance.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>1. Scope of FairlyWed Services</h4>

<p>1.1 The FairlyWed Platform is an online marketplace that enables registered users (“<strong>Members</strong>”) and certain
  third parties who offer services (Members and third parties who offer services are “<strong>Vendors</strong>” and the services
  they offer are “<strong>Vendor Services</strong>”) to publish such Vendor Services on the FairlyWed Platform (“<strong>Listings</strong>”)
  and to communicate and transact directly with Members that are seeking to book such Vendor Services (Members using Vendor
  Services are “<strong>Clients</strong>”). Vendor Services may include the offering of Photography, Videography, Venue,
  or DJ services.
</p>

<p>1.2 As the provider of the FairlyWed Platform, FairlyWed does not own, create, sell, resell, provide, control, manage, offer,
  deliver, or supply any Listings or Vendor Services. Vendors alone are responsible for their Listings and Vendor Services.
  When Members make or accept a booking, they are entering into a contract directly with each other. FairlyWed is not and
  does not become a party to or other participant in any contractual relationship between Members.</p>

<p>1.3 While we may help facilitate the resolution of disputes, FairlyWed has no control over and does not guarantee (i) the
  existence, quality, safety, suitability, or legality of any Listings or Vendor Services, (ii) the truth or accuracy of
  any Listing descriptions, Ratings, Reviews, or other Member Content, or (iii) the performance or conduct of any Member
  or third party. FairlyWed does not endorse any Member, Listing or Vendor Services. Any references to a Member being &quot;verified&quot;
  (or similar language) only indicate that the Member has completed a relevant verification or identification process and
  nothing else. Any such description is not an endorsement, certification or guarantee by FairlyWed about any Member, including
  of the Member's identity or background or whether the Member is trustworthy, safe or suitable. You should always exercise
  due diligence and care when online or in person. Verified Images (as defined below) are
  intended only to indicate a photographic representation of a Listing at the time the photograph was taken, and are therefore
  not an endorsement by FairlyWed of any Vendor or Listing.</p>

<p>1.4 If you choose to use the FairlyWed Platform as a Vendor or Co-Vendor (as defined below), your relationship with FairlyWed
  is limited to being an independent, third-party contractor, and not an employee, agent, joint venturer or partner of FairlyWed
  for any reason, and you act exclusively on your own behalf and for your own benefit, and not on behalf, or for the benefit,
  of FairlyWed.</p>

<p>1.5 To promote the FairlyWed Platform and to increase the exposure of Listings to potential Clients, Listings and other Member
  Content may be displayed on other websites, in applications, within emails, and in online and offline advertisements. To
  assist Members who speak different languages, Listings and other Member Content may be translated, in whole or in part,
  into other languages. FairlyWed cannot guarantee the accuracy or quality of such translations and Members are responsible
  for reviewing and verifying the accuracy of such translations. The FairlyWed Platform may contain translations powered
  by Google. Google disclaims all warranties related to the translations, express or implied, including any warranties of
  accuracy, reliability, and any implied warranties for merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and noninfringement.</p>

<p>1.6 The FairlyWed Platform may contain links to third-party websites or resources (“<strong>Third-Party Services</strong>”).
  Such Third-Party Services may be subject to different terms and conditions and privacy practices. FairlyWed is not responsible
  or liable for the availability or accuracy of such Third-Party Services, or the content, products, or services available
  from such Third-Party Services. Links to such Third-Party Services are not an endorsement by FairlyWed of such Third-Party
  Services.
</p>

<p>1.7 Due to the nature of the Internet, FairlyWed cannot guarantee the continuous and uninterrupted availability and accessibility
  of the FairlyWed Platform. FairlyWed may restrict the availability of the FairlyWed Platform or certain areas or features
  thereof, if this is necessary in view of capacity limits, the security or integrity of our servers, or to carry out maintenance
  measures that ensure the proper or improved functioning of the FairlyWed Platform. FairlyWed may improve, enhance and modify
  the FairlyWed Platform and introduce new FairlyWed Services from time to time.</p>

<h4>2. Eligibility, Using the FairlyWed Platform, Member Verification</h4>

<p>2.1 You must be at least 18 years old and able to enter into legally binding contracts to access and use the FairlyWed Platform
  or register a FairlyWed Account. By accessing or using the FairlyWed Platform you represent and warrant that you are 18
  or older and have the legal capacity and authority to enter into a contract.</p>

<p>2.2 You will comply with any applicable export control laws in your local jurisdiction. You also represent and warrant that
  (i) neither you nor your Vendor Service(s) are located or take place in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government
  embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a &quot;terrorist supporting&quot; country, and (ii) you
  are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.</p>

<p>2.3 FairlyWed may make the access to and use of the FairlyWed Platform, or certain areas or features of the FairlyWed Platform,
  subject to certain conditions or requirements, such as completing a verification process, meeting specific quality or eligibility
  criteria, meeting Ratings or Reviews thresholds, or booking and cancellation history.</p>

<p>2.4 User verification on the Internet is difficult and we do not assume any responsibility for the confirmation of any Member’s
  identity. Notwithstanding the above, for transparency and fraud prevention purposes, and as permitted by applicable laws,
  we may, but have no obligation to (i) ask Members to provide a form of government identification or other information or
  undertake additional checks designed to help verify the identities or backgrounds of Members, (ii) screen Members against
  third party databases or other sources and request reports from service providers, and (iii) where we have sufficient information
  to identify a Member, obtain reports from public records of criminal convictions or sex offender registrations or an equivalent
  version of background or registered sex offender checks in your local jurisdiction (if available).</p>

<p>2.5 The access to or use of certain areas and features of the FairlyWed Platform may be subject to separate policies, standards
  or guidelines, or may require that you accept additional terms and conditions. If there is a conflict between these Terms
  and terms and conditions applicable to a specific area or feature of the FairlyWed Platform, the latter terms and conditions
  will take precedence with respect to your access to or use of that area or feature, unless specified otherwise.</p>

<p>2.6 If you access or download the Application from the Apple App Store, you agree to <a href="http://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/appstore/dev/stdeula/">Apple’s Licensed Application End User License Agreement</a>.
  Some areas of the FairlyWed Platform implement Google Maps/Earth mapping services, including Google Maps API(s). Your use
  of Google Maps/Earth is subject to the <a href="https://www.google.com/help/terms_maps.html">Google Maps/Google Earth Additional Terms of Service</a>.</p>

<h4>3. Modification of these Terms</h4>

<p>FairlyWed reserves the right to modify these Terms at any time in accordance with this provision. If we make changes to these
  Terms, we will post the revised Terms on the FairlyWed Platform and update the “Last Updated” date at the top of these
  Terms. We will also provide you with notice of the modifications by email at least thirty (30) days before the date they
  become effective. If you disagree with the revised Terms, you may terminate this Agreement with immediate effect. We will
  inform you about your right to terminate the Agreement in the notification email. If you do not terminate your Agreement
  before the date the revised Terms become effective, your continued access to or use of the FairlyWed Platform will constitute
  acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>

<h4>4. Account Registration</h4>

<p>4.1 You must register an account (&quot;<strong>FairlyWed Account</strong>&quot;) to access and use certain features of the
  FairlyWed Platform, such as publishing or booking a Listing. If you are registering a FairlyWed Account for a company or
  other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to legally bind that entity and grant us all
  permissions and licenses provided in these Terms.</p>

<p>4.2 You can register a FairlyWed Account using an email address and creating a password, or through your account with certain
  third-party social networking services, such as Facebook or Google (&quot;<strong>SNS Account</strong>&quot;). You have
  the ability to disable the connection between your FairlyWed Account and your SNS Account at any time, by accessing the
  &quot;Settings&quot; section of the FairlyWed Platform.</p>

<p>4.3 You must provide accurate, current and complete information during the registration process and keep your FairlyWed Account
  and public FairlyWed Account profile page information up-to-date at all times.</p>

<p>4.4 You may not register more than one (1) FairlyWed Account unless FairlyWed authorizes you to do so. You may not assign
  or otherwise transfer your FairlyWed Account to another party.</p>

<p>4.5 You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your FairlyWed Account credentials and may not
  disclose your credentials to any third party. You must immediately notify FairlyWed if you know or have any reason to suspect
  that your credentials have been lost, stolen, misappropriated, or otherwise compromised or in case of any actual or suspected
  unauthorized use of your FairlyWed Account. You are liable for any and all activities conducted through your FairlyWed
  Account, unless such activities are not authorized by you and you are not otherwise negligent (such as failing to report
  the unauthorized use or loss of your credentials).</p>

<p>4.6 FairlyWed may enable features that allow you to authorize other Members or certain third parties to take certain actions
  that affect your FairlyWed Account. For example, we may allow Members associated with an Enterprise (as defined in our
  Privacy Policy) to book for other Members, or we may allow Vendors to add other Members as Co-Vendors (as defined below)
  to help manage their Listings. These features do not require that you share your credentials with any other person. No
  third party is authorized by FairlyWed to ask for your credentials, and you shall not request the credentials of another
  Member.
</p>

<h4>5. Content</h4>

<p>5.1 FairlyWed may, at its sole discretion, enable Members to (i) create, upload, post, send, receive and store content, such
  as text, photos, audio, video, or other materials and information on or through the FairlyWed Platform (&quot;<strong>Member Content</strong>&quot;);
  and (ii) access and view Member Content and any content that FairlyWed itself makes available on or through the FairlyWed
  Platform, including proprietary FairlyWed content and any content licensed or authorized for use by or through FairlyWed
  from a third party (&quot;<strong>FairlyWed Content</strong>&quot; and together with Member Content, &quot;<strong>Collective Content</strong>&quot;).</p>

<p>5.2 The FairlyWed Platform, FairlyWed Content, and Member Content may in its entirety or in part be protected by copyright,
  trademark, and/or other laws of the United States and other countries. You acknowledge and agree that the FairlyWed Platform
  and FairlyWed Content, including all associated intellectual property rights, are the exclusive property of FairlyWed and/or
  its licensors or authorizing third-parties. You will not remove, alter or obscure any copyright, trademark, service mark
  or other proprietary rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the FairlyWed Platform, FairlyWed Content or Member
  Content. All trademarks, service marks, logos, trade names, and any other source identifiers of FairlyWed used on or in
  connection with the FairlyWed Platform and FairlyWed Content are trademarks or registered trademarks of FairlyWed in the
  United States and abroad. Trademarks, service marks, logos, trade names and any other proprietary designations of third
  parties used on or in connection with the FairlyWed Platform, FairlyWed Content, and/or Collective Content are used for
  identification purposes only and may be the property of their respective owners.</p>

<p>5.3 You will not use, copy, adapt, modify, prepare derivative works of, distribute, license, sell, transfer, publicly display,
  publicly perform, transmit, broadcast or otherwise exploit the FairlyWed Platform or Collective Content, except to the
  extent you are the legal owner of certain Member Content or as expressly permitted in these Terms. No licenses or rights
  are granted to you by implication or otherwise under any intellectual property rights owned or controlled by FairlyWed
  or its licensors, except for the licenses and rights expressly granted in these Terms.</p>

<p>5.4 Subject to your compliance with these Terms, FairlyWed grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, revocable,
  non-transferable license to (i) download and use the Application on your personal device(s); and (ii) access and view any
  Collective Content made available on or through the FairlyWed Platform and accessible to you, solely for your personal
  and non-commercial use.</p>

<p>5.5 By creating, uploading, posting, sending, receiving, storing, or otherwise making available any Member Content on or
  through the FairlyWed Platform, you grant to FairlyWed a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable, perpetual
  (or for the term of the protection), sub-licensable and transferable license to such Member Content to access, use, store,
  copy, modify, prepare derivative works of, distribute, publish, transmit, stream, broadcast, and otherwise exploit in any
  manner such Member Content to provide and/or promote the FairlyWed Platform, in any media or platform. Unless you provide
  specific consent, FairlyWed does not claim any ownership rights in any Member Content and nothing in these Terms will be
  deemed to restrict any rights that you may have to use or exploit your Member Content.</p>

<p>5.6 FairlyWed may offer Vendors the option of having professional photographers or videographers take photographs or videos of their Vendor Services,
  which are made available by the photographer to Vendors to include in their Listings with or without a watermark or tag
  bearing the words &quot;FairlyWed.com Verified Photo&quot; or similar wording (&quot;<strong>Verified Images</strong>&quot;).
  You are responsible for ensuring that your Vendor Service is accurately represented in the Verified Images and you will
  stop using the Verified Images on or through the FairlyWed Platform if they no longer accurately represent your Listing,
  if you stop providing the Vendor Service featured, or if your FairlyWed Account is terminated or suspended for any reason.
  You acknowledge and agree that FairlyWed shall have the right to use any Verified Images in advertising, marketing and/or
  any other business purposes in any media or platform, whether in relation to your Listing or otherwise, without further
  notice or compensation to you. Where FairlyWed is not the exclusive owner of Verified Images, by using such Verified Images
  on or through the FairlyWed Platform, you grant to FairlyWed an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable, perpetual
  (or for the term of the protection), sub-licensable and transferable license to use such Verified Images for advertising,
  marketing and/or any other business purposes in any media or platform, whether in relation to your Listing or otherwise,
  without further notice or compensation to you. FairlyWed in turn grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable,
  revocable, non-transferable license to use Verified Images outside of the FairlyWed Platform solely for your personal and
  non-commercial use.</p>

<p>5.7 You are solely responsible for all Member Content that you make available on or through the FairlyWed Platform. Accordingly,
  you represent and warrant that: (i) you either are the sole and exclusive owner of all Member Content that you make available
  on or through the FairlyWed Platform or you have all rights, licenses, consents and releases that are necessary to grant
  to FairlyWed the rights in and to such Member Content, as contemplated under these Terms; and (ii) neither the Member Content
  nor your posting, uploading, publication, submission or transmittal of the Member Content or FairlyWed's use of the Member
  Content (or any portion thereof) will infringe, misappropriate or violate a third party's patent, copyright, trademark,
  trade secret, moral rights or other proprietary or intellectual property rights, or rights of publicity or privacy, or
  result in the violation of any applicable law or regulation.</p>

<p>5.8 You will not post, upload, publish, submit or transmit any Member Content that: (i) is fraudulent, false, misleading
  (directly or by omission or failure to update information) or deceptive; (ii) is defamatory, libelous, obscene, pornographic,
  vulgar or offensive; (iii) promotes discrimination, bigotry, racism, hatred, harassment or harm against any individual
  or group; (iv) is violent or threatening or promotes violence or actions that are threatening to any other person; (v)
  promotes illegal or harmful activities or substances; or (vi) violates any other FairlyWed policy. FairlyWed may, without prior notice, remove or disable access to any Member Content that
  FairlyWed finds to be in violation of these Terms or FairlyWed’s then-current <a ui-sref="policies.terms">Policies</a>, or otherwise may be harmful or objectionable to FairlyWed, its Members, third parties,
  or property.</p>

<p>5.9 FairlyWed respects copyright law and expects its Members to do the same. If you believe that any content on the FairlyWed
  Platform infringes copyrights you own, please notify us in accordance with our <a ui-sref="policies.copyright">Copyright Policy</a>.</p>

<h4>6. Service Fees</h4>

<p>6.1 FairlyWed may charge fees to Vendors (&quot;<strong>Vendor Fees</strong>&quot;) and/or Clients (&quot;<strong>Client Fees</strong>&quot;)
  (collectively, &quot;<strong>Service Fees</strong>&quot;) in consideration for the use of the FairlyWed Platform. More
  information about when Service Fees apply and how they are calculated can be found on our <a ui-sref="help.faq">Help/FAQ Page</a>.</p>

<p>6.2 Any applicable Service Fees (including any applicable Taxes) will be displayed to a Vendor or Client prior to publishing
  or booking a Listing. FairlyWed reserves the right to change the Service Fees at any time, and we will provide Members
  adequate notice of any fee changes before they become effective.</p>

<p>6.3 You are responsible for paying any Service Fees that you owe to FairlyWed. The applicable Service Fees are due and payable
  and collected by FairlyWed Payments pursuant to the <a ui-sref="policies.payments">Payments Terms</a>. Except as otherwise
  provided on the FairlyWed Platform, Service Fees are non-refundable.</p>

<h4>7. Terms specific for Vendors</h4>

<h5>7.1 Terms applicable to all Listings</h5>

<p>7.1.1 When creating a Listing through the FairlyWed Platform you must (i) provide complete and accurate information about
  your Vendor Service (such as listing description, location, and calendar availability), (ii) disclose any deficiencies,
  restrictions (such as house rules) and requirements that apply (such as any minimum age, proficiency or fitness requirements
  for an Experience) and (iii) provide any other pertinent information requested by FairlyWed. You are responsible for keeping
  your Listing information (including calendar availability) up-to-date at all times.</p>

<p>7.1.2 You are solely responsible for setting a price (including any Taxes if applicable) for your Listing (“<strong>Listing Fee</strong>”).
  Once a Client requests a booking of your Listing, you may not request that the Client pays a higher price than in the booking
  request.
</p>

<p>7.1.3 Any terms and conditions included in your Listing, in particular in relation to cancellations, must not conflict with
  these Terms or the cancellation policy you have selected for your Listing.</p>

<p>7.1.4 Pictures, animations or videos (collectively, &quot;<strong>Images</strong>&quot;) used in your Listings must accurately
  reflect the quality of your Vendor Services. FairlyWed reserves the right to require that Listings have a
  minimum number of Images of a certain format, size and resolution.</p>

<p>7.1.5 The placement and ranking of Listings in search results on the FairlyWed Platform may vary and depend on a variety
  of factors, such as Client search parameters and preferences, Vendor requirements, price and calendar availability, number
  and quality of Images, customer service and cancellation history, Reviews and Ratings, type of Vendor Service, and/or ease
  of booking.</p>

<p>7.1.6 When you accept or have pre-approved a booking request by a Client, you are entering into a legally binding agreement
  with the Client and are required to provide your Vendor Service(s) to the Client as described in your Listing when the
  booking request is made. You also agree to pay the applicable Vendor Fee and any applicable Taxes, which will be collected
  pursuant to the <a ui-sref="policies.payment">Payments Terms</a>.</p>

<p>7.1.7 FairlyWed recommends that Vendors obtain appropriate insurance for their Vendor Services. Please review any respective
  insurance policy carefully, and in particular make sure that you are familiar with and understand any exclusions to, and
  any deductibles that may apply for, such insurance policy, including, but not limited to, whether or not your insurance
  policy will cover the actions or inactions of Clients.</p>

<h5>7.2 Listing Venues</h5>

<p>7.2.1 You may only list one Venue per Listing.</p>

<p>7.2.2 If you choose to require a security deposit for your Venue, you must specify this in your Listing (&quot;<strong>Security Deposit</strong>&quot;).
  Vendors are not allowed to ask for a Security Deposit after a booking has been confirmed or outside of the FairlyWed Platform.
  FairlyWed will use commercially reasonable efforts to address Vendors’ requests and claims related to Security Deposits,
  but FairlyWed is not responsible for administering or accepting any claims by Vendors related to Security Deposits.</p>

<p>7.2.3 You represent and warrant that any Listing you post and the booking of, or a Client's stay at, an Venue will
  (i) not breach any agreements you have entered into with any third parties, such as homeowners association, condominium,
  or other agreements, and (ii) comply with all applicable laws (such as zoning laws), Tax requirements, and other rules
  and regulations (including having all required permits, licenses and registrations). As a Vendor, you are responsible for
  your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of any individuals who reside at or are
  otherwise present at the Venue at your request or invitation, excluding the Client (and the individuals the Client
  invites to the Venue, if applicable).</p>

<h5>7.3 Listing Experiences, Events and other Vendor Services</h5>

<p>7.3.1 To list a Vendor Service, you must create a Listing and submit the 
  Vendor Service to FairlyWed. FairlyWed reserves the right to decide, in its sole discretion, if a submitted Vendor Service
  will be published on the FairlyWed Platform.</p>

<p>7.3.2 You represent and warrant that you (i) understand and comply with all laws, rules and regulations that may apply to
  your Vendor Service(s), and (ii) will obtain any required licenses, permits, or registrations
  prior to providing your Vendor Service(s).</p>

<p>7.3.3 You must provide a Vendor Service in person and may not allow any third party to provide
  the Vendor Service on your behalf, unless authorized by FairlyWed.</p>

<h5>7.4 Co-Vendors</h5>

<p>7.4.1 FairlyWed may enable Vendors to authorize other Members (“<strong>Co-Vendors</strong>”) to administer the Vendor’s
  Listing(s), and to bind the Vendor and take certain actions in relation to the Listing(s) as permitted by the Vendor, such
  as accepting booking requests, messaging and welcoming Clients, and updating the Listing Fee and calendar availability
  (collectively, “
  <strong>Co-Vendor Services</strong>”). Any agreement formed between Vendor and Co-Vendor may not conflict with these Terms
  and the <a ui-sref="policies.payment">Payments Terms</a>. Co-Vendors may only act in an individual capacity and not on
  behalf of a company or other organization, unless expressly authorized by FairlyWed. FairlyWed reserves the right, in our
  sole discretion, to limit the number of Co-Vendors a Vendor may invite for each Listing and to limit the number of Listings
  a Co-Vendor may manage.</p>

<p>7.4.2 Vendors and Co-Vendors may agree on a fee (“<strong>Co-Vendor Services Fee</strong>”) in consideration for the Co-Vendor
  Services provided by the Co-Vendor. When such an agreement is made, the Vendor agrees to pay the Co-Vendor Services Fee
  for any confirmed booking of their Listing, which will be deducted directly from the Listing Fee after deduction of any
  applicable Vendor Fee. In addition, Vendors may instruct a Co-Vendor to provide certain one-time services in relation to
  their Listing. Vendors can pay Co-Vendors for one-time services and any other expenses using the Resolution Center. FairlyWed
  Payments will process Co-Vendor Services Fees and Resolution Center payments pursuant to the <a ui-sref="policies.payment">Payments Terms</a>.</p>

<h4>8. Terms specific for Clients</h4>

<h5>8.1 Terms applicable to all bookings</h5>

<p>8.1.1 Subject to meeting any requirements (such as completing any verification processes) set by the Vendor, you can book
  a Listing available on the FairlyWed Platform by following the respective booking process. All applicable fees, including
  the Listing Fee, Security Deposit (if applicable), Client Fee and any applicable Taxes (collectively, “<strong>Total Fees</strong>”)
  will be presented to you prior to booking a Listing. You agree to pay the Total Fees for any booking requested in connection
  with your FairlyWed Account.</p>

<p>8.1.2 Upon receipt of a booking confirmation from FairlyWed, a legally binding agreement is formed between you and your Vendor,
  subject to any additional terms and conditions of the Vendor that apply, including in particular the applicable cancellation
  policy and any rules and restrictions specified in the Listing. FairlyWed Payments will collect the Total Fees at the time
  of the booking request or upon the Vendor’s confirmation pursuant to the <a ui-sref="policies.payment">Payments Terms</a>.</p>

<p>8.1.3 If you book a Vendor Service on behalf of additional clients, you are required to ensure that every additional client
  meets any requirements set by the Vendor, and is made aware of and agrees to these Terms and any terms and conditions,
  rules and restrictions set by the Vendor. If you are booking for an additional client who is a minor, you represent and
  warrant that you are legally authorized to act on behalf of the minor. Minors may only participate in a Vendor Service if accompanied by an adult who is responsible for them.</p>

<h5>8.2 Booking Venues</h5>

<p>8.2.1 You understand that a confirmed booking of an Venue (“<strong>Venue Booking</strong>”) is a limited
  license granted to you by the Vendor to enter, occupy and use the Venue for the duration of your stay, during which
  time the Vendor (only where and to the extent permitted by applicable law) retains the right to re-enter the Venue,
  in accordance with your agreement with the Vendor.</p>

<p>8.2.2 You agree to leave the Venue no later than the checkout time that the Vendor specifies in the Listing or such
  other time as mutually agreed upon between you and the Vendor. If you stay past the agreed upon checkout time without the
  Vendor's consent (“<strong>Overstay</strong>”), you no longer have a license to stay in the Venue and the Vendor
  is entitled to make you leave in a manner consistent with applicable law. In addition, you agree to pay, if requested by
  the Vendor, for each twenty-four (24) hour period (or any portion thereof) that you Overstay, an additional nightly fee
  of up to two (2) times the average nightly Listing Fee originally paid by you to cover the inconvenience suffered by the
  Vendor, plus all applicable Client Fees, Taxes, and any legal expenses incurred by the Vendor to make you leave (collectively,
  &quot;
  <strong>Overstay Fees</strong>&quot;). Overstay Fees for late checkouts on the checkout date that do not impact upcoming
  bookings may be limited to the additional costs incurred by the Vendor as a result of such Overstay. FairlyWed Payments
  will collect Overstay Fees from you pursuant to the <a ui-sref="policies.payment">Payments Terms</a>. A Security Deposit,
  if required by a Vendor, may be applied to any Overstay Fees due for a Client’s Overstay.</p>

<h5>8.3 Booking Experiences, Events and other Vendor Services</h5>

<p>8.3.1 You should carefully review the description of any Vendor Service you intend to book.</p>

<h4>9. Booking Modifications, Cancellations and Refunds, Resolution Center</h4>

<p>9.1 Vendors and Clients are responsible for any modifications to a booking that they make via the FairlyWed Platform or direct
  FairlyWed customer service to make (&quot;<strong>Booking Modifications</strong>&quot;), and agree to pay any additional
  Listing Fees, Vendor Fees or Client Fees and/or Taxes associated with such Booking Modifications.</p>

<p>9.2 FairlyWed does not initiate cancellations based on the request of Clients. However, Clients can cancel a confirmed booking at any time subject to the Listing’s cancellation policy.</p>

<p>9.3 If a Vendor cancels a confirmed booking, the Client will receive a full refund of the Total Fees for such booking and
  FairlyWed may publish an automated review on the Listing cancelled by the Vendor indicating that a booking was cancelled.
  In addition, FairlyWed may (i) keep the calendar for the Listing unavailable or blocked for the dates of the cancelled
  booking, and/or (ii) impose a cancellation fee, unless the Vendor has a valid reason for cancelling the booking or has legitimate concerns about the Client’s behavior.</p>

<p>9.4 For Experiences, Events and other Vendor Services, if inclement weather creates an unsafe or uncomfortable scenario for
  Clients, Vendors may modify or cancel a Vendor Service. If there is a substantial change in the itinerary or the Vendor
  Service needs to be cancelled, FairlyWed will work with the Vendor to provide Clients an alternative date for the Vendor
  Service, an appropriate refund or a rebooking.</p>

<p>9.5 In certain circumstances, FairlyWed may decide, in its sole discretion, that it is necessary to cancel a confirmed booking
  and make appropriate refund and payout decisions.</p>

<h4>10. Ratings and Reviews</h4>

<p>10.1 Within a certain timeframe after completing a booking, Clients and Vendors can leave a public review (“<strong>Review</strong>”)
  and submit a star rating (“<strong>Rating</strong>”) about each other. Any Ratings or Reviews reflect the opinion of individual
  Members and do not reflect the opinion of FairlyWed. Ratings and Reviews are not verified by FairlyWed for accuracy and
  may be incorrect or misleading.</p>

<p>10.2 Ratings and Reviews by Clients and Vendors must be fair, truthful and factual and may not contain any offensive or defamatory
  language.</p>

<p>10.3 Members are prohibited from manipulating the Ratings and Reviews system in any manner, such as instructing a third party
  write a positive or negative Review about another Member.</p>

<h4>
  </a> 11. Damage to Venues, Disputes between Members</h4>

<p>11.1 As a Client, you are responsible for leaving the Venue (including any personal or other property located at
  the Venue) in the condition it was in when you arrived. You are responsible for your own acts and omissions and
  are also responsible for the acts and omissions of any individuals whom you invite to, or otherwise provide access to,
  the Venue, excluding the Vendor (and the individuals the Vendor invites to the Venue, if applicable).</p>

<p>11.2 If a Vendor claims and provides evidence that you as a Client have damaged an Venue or any personal or other
  property at an Venue (&quot;<strong>Damage Claim</strong>&quot;), the Vendor can seek payment from you through
  the Resolution Center. If a Vendor escalates a Damage Claim to FairlyWed, you will be given an opportunity to respond.
  If you agree to pay the Vendor, or FairlyWed determines in its sole discretion that you are responsible for the Damage
  Claim, FairlyWed Payments will collect any such sums from you and/or against the Security Deposit (if applicable) required
  to cover the Damage Claim pursuant to the <a ui-sref="policies.payment">Payments Terms</a>. FairlyWed also reserves the
  right to otherwise collect payment from you and pursue any remedies available to FairlyWed in this regard in situations
  in which you are responsible for a Damage Claim, including, but not limited to, in relation to any payment requests made
  by Vendors under the FairlyWed Vendor Guarantee.</p>

<p>11.3 Members agree to cooperate with and assist FairlyWed in good faith, and to provide FairlyWed with such information and
  take such actions as may be reasonably requested by FairlyWed, in connection with any Damage Claims or other complaints
  or claims made by Members relating to Venues or any personal or other property located at an Venue (including,
  without limitation, payment requests made under the FairlyWed Vendor Guarantee), Experiences, or Co-Vendor agreements.
  A Member shall, upon FairlyWed's reasonable request and at no cost to the Member, participate in mediation or a similar
  resolution process with another Member, which process will be conducted by FairlyWed or a third party selected by FairlyWed
  or its insurer, with respect to losses for which a Member is requesting payment from FairlyWed (including but not limited
  to payments under the FairlyWed Vendor Guarantee).</p>

<p>11.4 If you are a Client or a Co-Vendor, you understand and agree that FairlyWed may make a claim under your homeowner's,
  renter's or other insurance policy related to any damage or loss that you may have caused, or been responsible for, to
  an Venue or any personal or other property located at an Venue (including without limitation amounts paid
  by FairlyWed under the FairlyWed Vendor Guarantee). You agree to cooperate with and assist FairlyWed in good faith, and
  to provide FairlyWed with such information as may be reasonably requested by FairlyWed, to make a claim under your homeowner's,
  renter's or other insurance policy, including, but not limited to, executing documents and taking such further acts as
  FairlyWed may reasonably request to assist FairlyWed in accomplishing the foregoing.</p>

<h4>
  </a> 12. Rounding off, Currency conversion</h4>

<p>12.1 FairlyWed may, in its sole discretion, round up or round down amounts that are payable from or to Clients or Vendors
  to the nearest whole functional base unit in which the currency is denominated (i.e. to the nearest dollar, euro or other
  supported currency); for example, FairlyWed will round up an amount of $101.50 to $102.00, and round down an amount of
  $101.49 to $101.00. For currencies that are denominated in large numbers, FairlyWed may determine the functional base unit
  in which those currencies are denominated to be 10, 100 or 1,000 of the currency; for example, FairlyWed may round up an
  amount of 1,045 up to 1,050 and 1,044 down to 1,040, or 837,500 up to 838,000 and 837,499 down to 837,000.</p>

<p>12.2 The FairlyWed Platform facilitates bookings between Clients and Vendors who may prefer to pay in a currency different
  from their destination currency, which may require currency conversions to accommodate these differing currency preferences.
  Although the FairlyWed Platform allows Members to view the price of Listings in a number of currencies, the currencies
  available for Members to make and receive payments may be limited, and may not include the default currency in any given
  geographic location. Details regarding currency conversion, including any associated fees, are detailed in the <a ui-sref="policies.payment">Payments Terms</a>.</p>

<h4>
  </a> 13. Taxes</h4>

<p>13.1 As a Vendor you are solely responsible for determining your obligations to report, collect, remit or include in your
  Listing Fees any applicable VAT or other indirect sales taxes, occupancy tax, tourist or other visitor taxes or income
  taxes (&quot;<strong>Taxes</strong>&quot;).</p>

<p>13.2 Tax regulations may require us to collect appropriate Tax information from Vendors, or to withhold Taxes from payouts
  to Vendors, or both. If a Vendor fails to provide us with documentation that we determine to be sufficient to alleviate
  our obligation (if any) to withhold Taxes from payouts to you, we reserve the right to freeze all payouts, withhold such
  amounts as required by law, or to do both, until resolution.</p>

<p>13.3 You understand that any appropriate governmental agency, department and/or authority (&quot;<strong>Tax Authority</strong>&quot;)
  where your Venue is located may require Taxes to be collected from Clients or Vendors on Listing Fees, and to be
  remitted to the respective Tax Authority. The laws in jurisdictions may vary, but these Taxes may be required to be collected
  and remitted as a percentage of the Listing Fees set by Vendors, a set amount per day, or other variations, and are sometimes
  called &quot;transient occupancy taxes,&quot; &quot;hotel taxes,&quot; &quot;lodging taxes,&quot; &quot;city taxes,&quot;
  &quot;room taxes&quot; or &quot;tourist taxes&quot; (&quot;<strong>Occupancy Taxes</strong>&quot;).</p>

<p>13.4 In certain jurisdictions, FairlyWed may decide in its sole discretion to facilitate collection and remittance of Occupancy
  Taxes from or on behalf of Clients or Vendors, in accordance these Terms (&quot;<strong>Collection and Remittance</strong>&quot;)
  if such jurisdiction asserts FairlyWed or Vendors have an Occupancy Tax collection and remittance obligation. In any jurisdiction
  in which we decide to facilitate direct Collection and Remittance, you hereby instruct and authorize FairlyWed (via FairlyWed
  Payments) to collect Occupancy Taxes from Clients on the Vendor's behalf at the time Listing Fees are collected, and to
  remit such Occupancy Taxes to the Tax Authority. The amount of Occupancy Taxes, if any, collected and remitted by FairlyWed
  will be visible to and separately stated to both Clients and Vendors on their respective transaction documents. Where FairlyWed
  is facilitating Collection and Remittance, Vendors are not permitted to collect any Occupancy Taxes being collected by
  FairlyWed relating to their Venues in that jurisdiction.</p>

<p>13.5 You agree that any claim or cause of action relating to FairlyWed's facilitation of Collection and Remittance of Occupancy
  Taxes shall not extend to any supplier or vendor that may be used by FairlyWed in connection with facilitation of Collection
  and Remittance, if any. Clients and Vendors agree that we may seek additional amounts from you in the event that the Taxes
  collected and/or remitted are insufficient to fully discharge your obligations to the Tax Authority, and agree that your
  sole remedy for Occupancy Taxes collected is a refund of Occupancy Taxes collected by FairlyWed from the applicable Tax
  Authority in accordance with applicable procedures set by that Tax Authority.</p>

<p>13.6 FairlyWed reserves the right, with prior notice to Vendors, to cease the Collection and Remittance in any jurisdiction
  for any reason at which point Vendors and Clients are once again solely responsible and liable for the collection and/or
  remittance of any and all Occupancy Taxes that may apply to Venues in that jurisdiction.</p>

<h4>14. Prohibited Activities</h4>

<p>14.1 You are solely responsible for compliance with any and all laws, rules, regulations, and Tax obligations that may apply

  <li>discriminate against or harass anyone on the basis of race, national origin, religion, gender, gender identity, physical

    of your jurisdiction, and any other applicable laws; or</li>
  <li>violate or infringe anyone else’s rights or otherwise cause harm to anyone.</li>
</ul>

<p>14.2 You acknowledge that FairlyWed has no obligation to monitor the access to or use of the FairlyWed Platform by any Member
  or to review, disable access to, or edit any Member Content, but has the right to do so to (i) operate, secure and improve
  the FairlyWed Platform (including without limitation for fraud prevention, risk assessment, investigation and customer
  support purposes); (ii) ensure Members’ compliance with these Terms; (iii) comply with applicable law or the order or requirement
  of a court, law enforcement or other administrative agency or governmental body; (iv) respond to Member Content that it
  determines is harmful or objectionable; or (v) as otherwise set forth in these Terms. Members agree to cooperate with and
  assist FairlyWed in good faith, and to provide FairlyWed with such information and take such actions as may be reasonably
  requested by FairlyWed with respect to any investigation undertaken by FairlyWed or a representative of FairlyWed regarding
  the use or abuse of the FairlyWed Platform.</p>

<p>14.3 If you feel that any Member you interact with, whether online or in person, is acting or has acted inappropriately,
  including but not limited to anyone who (i) engages in offensive, violent or sexually inappropriate behavior, (ii) you
  suspect of stealing from you, or (iii) engages in any other disturbing conduct, you should immediately report such person
  to the appropriate authorities and then to FairlyWed by contacting us with your police station and report number (if available);
  provided that your report will not obligate us to take any action beyond that required by law (if any) or cause us to incur
  any liability to you.</p>

<h4>
  </a> 15. Term and Termination, Suspension and other Measures</h4>

<p>15.1 This Agreement shall be effective for a 30-day term, at the end of which it will automatically and continuously renew
  for subsequent 30-day terms until such time when you or FairlyWed terminate the Agreement in accordance with this provision.</p>

<p>15.2 You may terminate this Agreement at any time via the &quot;Cancel Account&quot; feature on the FairlyWed Platform or
  by sending us an email. If you cancel your FairlyWed Account as a Vendor, any confirmed booking(s) will be automatically
  cancelled and your Clients will receive a full refund. If you cancel your FairlyWed Account as a Client, any confirmed
  booking(s) will be automatically cancelled and any refund will depend upon the terms of the Listing’s cancellation policy.</p>

<p>15.3 Without limiting our rights specified below, FairlyWed may terminate this Agreement for convenience at any time by giving
  you thirty (30) days' notice via email to your registered email address.</p>

<p>15.4 FairlyWed may immediately, without notice terminate this Agreement if (i) you have materially breached your obligations
  under these Terms, the <a ui-sref="policies.payment">Payments Terms</a>, (ii) you have violated applicable laws, regulations or third party rights, or (iii)
  FairlyWed believes in good faith that such action is reasonably necessary to protect the personal safety or property of
  FairlyWed, its Members, or third parties (for example in the case of fraudulent behavior of a Member).</p>

<p>15.5 In addition, FairlyWed may take any of the following measures (i) to comply with applicable law, or the order or request
  of a court, law enforcement or other administrative agency or governmental body, or if (ii) you have breached these Terms,
  the <a ui-sref="policies.payment">Payments Terms</a>, applicable laws, regulations, or third party rights, (iii) you have provided inaccurate,
  fraudulent, outdated or incomplete information during the FairlyWed Account registration, Listing process or thereafter,
  (iv) you and/or your Listings or Vendor Services at any time fail to meet any applicable quality or eligibility criteria,
  (v) you have repeatedly received poor Ratings or Reviews or FairlyWed otherwise becomes aware of or has received complaints
  about your performance or conduct, (vi) you have repeatedly cancelled confirmed bookings or failed to respond to booking
  requests without a valid reason, or (vii) FairlyWed believes in good faith that such action is reasonably necessary to
  protect the personal safety or property of FairlyWed, its Members, or third parties, or to prevent fraud or other illegal
  activity:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>refuse to surface, delete or delay any Listings, Ratings, Reviews, or other Member Content;</li>
  <li>cancel any pending or confirmed bookings;</li>
  <li>limit your access to or use of the FairlyWed Platform;</li>
  <li>temporarily or permanently revoke any special status associated with your FairlyWed Account; or</li>

  an opportunity to resolve the issue to FairlyWed's reasonable satisfaction.</p>

<p>15.6 If we take any of the measures described above (i) we may refund your Clients in full for any and all confirmed bookings
  that have been cancelled, irrespective of preexisting cancellation policies, and (ii) you will not be entitled to any compensation
  for pending or confirmed bookings that were cancelled.</p>

<p>15.7 When this Agreement has been terminated, you are not entitled to a restoration of your FairlyWed Account or any of your
  Member Content. If your access to or use of the FairlyWed Platform has been limited or your FairlyWed Account has been
  suspended or this Agreement has been terminated by us, you may not register a new FairlyWed Account or access and use the
  FairlyWed Platform through a FairlyWed Account of another Member.</p>

<p>15.8 Unless you reside in Germany, if you or we terminate this Agreement, the clauses of these Terms that reasonably should
  survive termination of the Agreement will remain in effect.</p>

<h4>
  </a> 16. Disclaimers</h4>

<p><strong>If you choose to use the FairlyWed Platform or Collective Content, you do so voluntarily and at your sole risk. The FairlyWed Platform and Collective Content is provided “as is”, without warranty of any kind, either express or implied.</strong></p>

<p><strong>You agree that you have had whatever opportunity you deem necessary to investigate the FairlyWed Services, laws, rules, or regulations that may be applicable to your Listings and/or Vendor Services you are receiving and that you are not relying upon any statement of law or fact made by FairlyWed relating to a Listing.</strong></p>

<p><strong>If we choose to conduct identity verification or background checks on any Member, to the extent permitted by applicable law, we disclaim warranties of any kind, either express or implied, that such checks will identify prior misconduct by a Member or guarantee that a Member will not engage in misconduct in the future.</strong></p>

<p><strong>You agree that some Experiences, Events or other Vendor Services may carry inherent risk, and by participating in those Vendor Services, you choose to assume those risks voluntarily. For example, some Vendor Services may carry risk of illness, bodily injury, disability, or death, and you freely and willfully assume those risks by choosing to participate in those Vendor Services. You assume full responsibility for the choices you make before, during and after your participation in a Vendor Service. If you are bringing a minor as an additional client, you are solely responsible for the supervision of that minor throughout the duration of your Vendor Service and to the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to release and hold harmless FairlyWed from all liabilities and claims that arise in any way from any injury, death, loss or harm that occurs to that minor during the Vendor Service or in any way related to your Vendor Service.</strong></p>


<p><strong>The foregoing disclaimers apply to the maximum extent permitted by law. You may have other statutory rights. However, the duration of statutorily required warranties, if any, shall be limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.</strong></p>

<h4>
  </a> 17. Liability</h4>

<p><strong>17.1 Unless you reside in the EU, you acknowledge and agree that, to the maximum extent permitted by law, the entire risk arising out of your access to and use of the FairlyWed Platform and Collective Content, your publishing or booking of any Listing via the FairlyWed Platform, your stay at any Venue, participation in any Experience or Event or use of any other Vendor Service or any other interaction you have with other Members whether in person or online remains with you. Neither FairlyWed nor any other party involved in creating, producing, or delivering the FairlyWed Platform or Collective Content will be liable for any incidental, special, exemplary or consequential damages, including lost profits, loss of data or loss of goodwill, service interruption, computer damage or system failure or the cost of substitute products or services, or for any damages for personal or bodily injury or emotional distress arising out of or in connection with (i) these Terms, (ii) from the use of or inability to use the FairlyWed Platform or Collective Content, (iii) from any communications, interactions or meetings with other Members or other persons with whom you communicate, interact or meet with as a result of your use of the FairlyWed Platform, or (iv) from your publishing or booking of a Listing, including the provision or use of a Listing’s Vendor Services, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence), product liability or any other legal theory, and whether or not FairlyWed has been informed of the possibility of such damage, even if a limited remedy set forth herein is found to have failed of its essential purpose. Except for our obligations to pay amounts to applicable Vendors pursuant to these Terms or an approved payment request under the FairlyWed Vendor Guarantee, in no event will FairlyWed’s aggregate liability arising out of or in connection with these Terms and your use of the FairlyWed Platform including, but not limited to, from your publishing or booking of any Listings via the FairlyWed Platform, or from the use of or inability to use the FairlyWed Platform or Collective Content and in connection with any Venue, Experiences, Event or other Vendor Service, or interactions with any other Members, exceed the amounts you have paid or owe for bookings via the FairlyWed Platform as a Client in the twelve (12) month period prior to the event giving rise to the liability, or if you are a Vendor, the amounts paid by FairlyWed to you in the twelve (12) month period prior to the event giving rise to the liability, or one hundred U.S. dollars (US$100), if no such payments have been made, as applicable. The limitations of damages set forth above are fundamental elements of the basis of the bargain between FairlyWed and you. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so the above limitation may not apply to you. If you reside outside of the U.S., this does not affect FairlyWed’s liability for death or personal injury arising from its negligence, nor for fraudulent misrepresentation, misrepresentation as to a fundamental matter or any other liability which cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law.</strong></p>

<p><strong>17.2 If you reside in the EU, FairlyWed is liable under statutory provisions for intent and gross negligence by us, our legal representatives, directors, or other vicarious agents. The same applies to the assumption of guarantees or any other strict liability, or in case of a culpable injury to life, limb, or health. FairlyWed is liable for any negligent breaches of essential contractual obligations by us, our legal representatives, directors, or other vicarious agents. Essential contractual obligations are such duties of FairlyWed in whose proper fulfilment you regularly trust and must trust for the proper execution of the contract but the amount shall be limited to the typically occurring foreseeable damage. Any additional liability of FairlyWed is excluded.</strong></p>

<h4>
  </a> 18. Indemnification</h4>

<p>You agree to release, defend (at FairlyWed’s option), indemnify, and hold FairlyWed and its affiliates and subsidiaries,
  and their officers, directors, employees and agents, harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses,
  and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees, arising out of or in any way connected
  with (i) your breach of these Terms or our Policies or Standards, (ii) your improper use of the FairlyWed Platform or any
  FairlyWed Services, (iii) your interaction with any Member, stay at an Venue, participation in a Vendor Service, including without limitation any injuries, losses or damages (whether compensatory, direct, incidental,
  consequential or otherwise) of any kind arising in connection with or as a result of such interaction, stay, participation
  or use, (iv) FairlyWed’s Collection and Remittance of Occupancy Taxes, or (v) your breach of any laws, regulations or third
  party rights.</p>

<h4>
  </a> 19. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Agreement</h4>

<p>19.1 This Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Agreement shall apply if you (i) reside in the United States; or (ii) do not
  reside in the United States, but bring any claim against FairlyWed in the United States (to the extent not in conflict
  with Section 21).</p>

<p>19.2 <em>Overview of Dispute Resolution Process</em>. FairlyWed is committed to participating in a consumer-friendly dispute
  resolution process. To that end, these Terms provide for a two-part process for individuals to whom Section 19.1 applies:
  (1) an informal negotiation directly with FairlyWed’s customer service team, and (2) a binding arbitration administered
  by the American Arbitration Association (“<strong>AAA</strong>”) using its specially designed Consumer Arbitration Rules
  (as modified by this Section 19). Specifically, the process provides:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Claims can be filed with AAA online (<a href="http://www.adr.org/" target="_blank">www.adr.org</a>);</li>
  <li>Arbitrators must be neutral and no party may unilaterally select an arbitrator;</li>
  <li>Arbitrators must disclose any bias, interest in the result of the arbitration, or relationship with any party;</li>
  <li>Parties retain the right to seek relief in small claims court for certain claims, at their option;</li>
  <li>The initial filing fee for the consumer is capped at $200;</li>
  <li>The consumer gets to elect the hearing location and can elect to participate live, by phone, video conference, or, for
    claims under $25,000, by the submission of documents;</li>
  <li>The arbitrator can grant any remedy that the parties could have received in court to resolve the party’s individual claim.</li>
</ul>

<p>19.3 <em>Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution and Notification</em>. Prior to initiating an arbitration, you and FairlyWed
  each agree to notify the other party of the dispute and attempt to negotiate an informal resolution to it first. We will
  contact you at the email address you have provided to us; you can contact FairlyWed’s customer service team by <a href="mailto:terms@FairlyWed.com">emailing us</a>.
  If after a good faith effort to negotiate one of us feels the dispute has not and cannot be resolved informally, the party
  intending to pursue arbitration agrees to notify the other party via email prior to initiating the arbitration. In order
  to initiate arbitration, a claim must be filed with the AAA and the written Demand for Arbitration (available at <a href="https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Demand%20for%20Arbitration%20Consumer%20Arbitration%20Rules.pdf"
    target="_blank">www.adr.org</a>) provided to the other party, as specified in the AAA Rules.</p>

<p><strong>19.4 <em>Agreement to Arbitrate</em>. You and FairlyWed mutually agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement or interpretation thereof, or to the use of the FairlyWed Platform, the Vendor Services, or the Collective Content (collectively, “Disputes”) will be settled by binding arbitration (the “Arbitration Agreement”). If there is a dispute about whether this Arbitration Agreement can be enforced or applies to our Dispute, you and FairlyWed agree that the arbitrator will decide that issue.</strong></p>

<p>19.5 <em>Exceptions to Arbitration Agreement</em>. You and FairlyWed each agree that the following claims are exceptions
  to the Arbitration Agreement and will be brought in a judicial proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction: (i) Any
  claim related to actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks,
  trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights; (ii) Any claim seeking emergency injunctive relief based
  on exigent circumstances (e.g., imminent danger or commission of a crime, hacking, cyber-attack).</p>

<p>19.6 <em>Arbitration Rules and Governing Law</em>. This Arbitration Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce
  and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. The arbitration will
  be administered by AAA in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “<strong>AAA Rules</strong>“) then in effect,
  except as modified here. The AAA Rules are available at <a href="http://www.adr.org/" target="_blank">www.adr.org</a> or
  by calling the AAA at 1–800–778–7879.</p>

<p>19.7 <em>Modification to AAA Rules - Arbitration Hearing/Location</em>. In order to make the arbitration most convenient
  to you, FairlyWed agrees that any required arbitration hearing may be conducted, at your option, (a) in the county where
  you reside; (b) in San Francisco County; (c) in any other location to which you and FairlyWed both agree; (d) via phone
  or video conference; or (e) for any claim or counterclaim under $25,000, by solely the submission of documents to the arbitrator.</p>

<p>19.8 <em>Modification of AAA Rules - Attorney’s Fees and Costs</em>. You may be entitled to seek an award of attorney fees
  and expenses if you prevail in arbitration, to the extent provided under applicable law and the AAA rules. Unless the arbitrator
  determines that your claim was frivolous or filed for the purpose of harassment, FairlyWed agrees it will not seek, and
  hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law or the AAA rules, to recover attorneys’ fees and expenses if
  it prevails in arbitration.</p>

<p>19.9 <em>Arbitrator’s Decision</em>. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which
  the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court with proper jurisdiction.
  The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only on an individual basis and only to the extent necessary
  to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim.</p>

<p><strong>19.10 <em>Jury Trial Waiver</em>. You and FairlyWed acknowledge and agree that we are each waiving the right to a trial by jury as to all arbitrable Disputes.</strong></p>

<p><strong>19.11 <em>No Class Actions or Representative Proceedings</em>. You and FairlyWed acknowledge and agree that we are each waiving the right to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action lawsuit, class-wide arbitration, private attorney-general action, or any other representative proceeding as to all Disputes. Further, unless you and FairlyWed both otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one party’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this paragraph is held unenforceable with respect to any Dispute, then the entirety of the Arbitration Agreement will be deemed void with respect to such Dispute.</strong></p>

<p>19.12 <em>Severability</em>. Except as provided in Section 19.11, in the event that any portion of this Arbitration Agreement
  is deemed illegal or unenforceable, such provision shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall
  be given full force and effect.</p>

<p>19.13 <em>Changes</em>. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3 (“Modification of these Terms”), if FairlyWed changes
  this Section 19 (“Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Agreement”) after the date you last accepted these Terms (or accepted
  any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email)
  within thirty (30) days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Last Updated” date above or in the
  date of FairlyWed’s email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will
  arbitrate any Dispute between you and FairlyWed in accordance with the provisions of the “Dispute Resolution and Arbitration
  Agreement” section as of the date you last accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).</p>

<p>19.14 <em>Survival</em>. Except as provided in Section 19.12 and subject to Section 15.8, this Section 19 will survive any
  termination of these Terms and will continue to apply even if you stop using the FairlyWed Platform or terminate your FairlyWed
  Account.

  </a> 21. Applicable Law and Jurisdiction</h4>

<p>21.1 If you reside in the United States, these Terms will be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California
  and the United States of America, without regard to conflict-of-law provisions. Judicial proceedings (other than small
  claims actions) that are excluded from the Arbitration Agreement in Section 19 must be brought in state or federal court
  in San Francisco, California, unless we both agree to some other location. You and we both consent to venue and personal
  jurisdiction in San Francisco, California.</p>

<p>21.2 If you reside in China these Terms will be interpreted in accordance with the laws of China (“<strong>China Laws</strong>”).
  Any dispute arising from or in connection with this Agreement shall be submitted to the China International Economic and
  Trade Arbitration Commission (CIETAC) for arbitration in Beijing which shall be conducted in accordance with CIETAC’s arbitration
  rules in effect at the time of applying for arbitration, provided that this section shall not be construed to limit any
  rights which FairlyWed may have to apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for an order requiring you to perform or
  be prohibited from performing certain acts and other provisional relief permitted under China Laws or any other laws that
  may apply to you. The arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in English. The arbitral award rendered is final and binding
  upon both parties.</p>

<p>21.3 If you reside outside of the United States and China, these Terms will be interpreted in accordance with Irish law.
  The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) is excluded. The
  choice of law does not impact your rights as a consumer according to the consumer protection regulations of your country
  of residence. If you are acting as a consumer, you agree to submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the Irish courts.
  Judicial proceedings that you are able to bring against us arising from or in connection with these Terms may only be brought
  in a court located in Ireland or a court with jurisdiction in your place of residence. If FairlyWed wishes to enforce any
  of its rights against you as a consumer, we may do so only in the courts of the jurisdiction in which you are a resident.
  If you are acting as a business, you agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Irish courts.</p>
