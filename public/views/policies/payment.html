<p>12.1 If you as a Guest (i) agree to pay the Host in connection with a Damage Claim, or (ii) FairlyWed determines that you are responsible for damaging an Accommodation or any personal or other property located at an Accommodation pursuant to the <a href="/terms">FairlyWed Terms</a>, you authorize FairlyWed Payments to charge the Payment Method used to make the booking in order to collect any Security Deposit associated with the Listing, as well as any amount of the Damage Claim exceeding any Security Deposit. If the Listing does not have a Security Deposit, FairlyWed Payments may charge the Payment Method used to make the booking for the amount of the Damage Claim. If we are unable to collect from your Payment Method used to make the booking, you agree that FairlyWed Payments may charge any other Payment Method on file (and not otherwise unauthorized) in your FairlyWed Account at the time of the Damage Claim.</p>

<p>12.2 FairlyWed Payments also reserves the right to otherwise collect payment from you and pursue any remedies available to FairlyWed Payments in situations in which you are responsible for a Damage Claim, including, but not limited to, in relation to any payment requests made by Hosts under the <a href="/guarantee">FairlyWed Host Guarantee</a>.</p>

<p>12.3 Security Deposits, if required by a Host, may be applied to any Overstay Fees due from a Guest.</p>

<h4></a> 13. Currency Conversion</h4>

<p>13.1 FairlyWed Payments will do a currency conversion in the following situations:</p>

<ul><li>Where a Guest submits a booking request for a Listing using a Booking Currency that is different from the Listing Country Currency, FairlyWed Payments will calculate the Total Fees in the Booking Currency by applying either the Base Exchange Rate or the Adjusted Exchange Rate to the Total Fees in the Listing Country Currency at the time of the booking request. Any fees that are based on a percentage of the applicable Listing Fees (such as Guest Fees), will be calculated based on the Listing Fees in the Booking Currency (i.e., after conversion from the Listing Country Currency). The Base Exchange Rate will be applied if FairlyWed is unable to process your transaction in the default currency of your Payment Method; in all other cases, the Adjusted Exchange Rate will apply.</li><li>When a confirmed booking is modified or cancelled, and a currency conversion has been applied, the Guest’s payment will be processed using the same Base Exchange Rate or Adjusted Exchange Rate applied at the time of the original booking.</li></ul>

<p>13.2 When you as a Guest submit a booking request for a Listing, and such request will be subject to a currency conversion, you will be able to view the exchange rate applied to do the currency conversion before you checkout.</p>

<h4></a> 14. Prohibited Activities</h4>

<p>You are solely responsible for compliance with any and all laws, rules, regulations, and Tax obligations that may apply to your use of the Payment Services. In connection with your use of the Payment Services, you may not and you agree that you will not and will not assist or enable others to:</p>

<h4></a> 17. Disclaimers</h4>

<p><strong>17.1 If you choose to use the Payment Services, you do so voluntarily and at your sole risk. The Payment Services are provided “as is”, without warranty of any kind, either express or implied.</strong></p>

<p><strong>17.2 Notwithstanding FairlyWed Payments’ appointment as the limited payment collection agent of Providing Members for the purposes of accepting payments from Purchasing Members through the FairlyWed Platform, FairlyWed Payments explicitly disclaims all liability for any act or omission of any Member or other third party. FairlyWed Payments does not have any duties or obligations as agent for each Providing Member except to the extent expressly set forth in these Payments Terms, and any additional duties or obligations as may be implied by law are expressly excluded.</strong></p>

<p><strong>17.3 If we choose to conduct identity verification on any Member, to the extent permitted by applicable law, we disclaim warranties of any kind, either express or implied, that such checks will identify prior misconduct by a Member or guarantee that a Member will not engage in misconduct in the future.</strong></p>

<p><strong>17.4 The foregoing disclaimers apply to the maximum extent permitted by law. You may have other statutory rights. However, the duration of statutorily required warranties, if any, shall be limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.</strong></p>

<h4></a> 18. Liability</h4>

<p><strong>18.1 You acknowledge and agree that, to the maximum extent permitted by law, the entire risk arising out of your access to and use of the Payment Services remains with you. If you permit or authorize another person to use your FairlyWed Account in any way, you are responsible for the actions taken by that person. Neither FairlyWed Payments nor any other party involved in creating, producing, or delivering the Payment Services will be liable for any incidental, special, exemplary, or consequential damages, including lost profits, loss of data or loss of goodwill, service interruption, computer damage or system failure or the cost of substitute products or services, or for any damages for personal or bodily injury or emotional distress arising out of or in connection with (i) these Payments Terms, (ii) from the use of or inability to use the Payment Services, or (iii) from any communications, interactions, or meetings with other Members or other persons with whom you communicate, interact, transact, or meet with as a result of your use of the Payment Services, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence), product liability, or any other legal theory, and whether or not FairlyWed Payments has been informed of the possibility of such damage, even if a limited remedy set forth herein is found to have failed of its essential purpose. Except for our obligations to pay amounts to applicable Providing Members pursuant to these Payments Terms or an approved payment request under the FairlyWed Host Guarantee, in no event will FairlyWed Payments’ aggregate liability arising out of or in connection with these Payments Terms and your use of the Payment Services including, but not limited to, from your use of or inability to use the Payment Services, exceed the amounts you have paid or owe for bookings via the FairlyWed Platform as a Guest in the twelve (12) month period prior to the event giving rise to the liability, or if you are a Host or Co-Host, the amounts paid by FairlyWed Payments to you in the twelve (12) month period prior to the event giving rise to the liability, or one hundred U.S. dollars (US$100), if no such payments have been made, as applicable. The limitations of damages set forth above are fundamental elements of the basis of the bargain between FairlyWed Payments and you. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so the above limitation may not apply to you. If you reside outside of the U.S., this does not affect FairlyWed Payments’ liability for death or personal injury arising from its negligence, nor for fraudulent misrepresentation, misrepresentation as to a fundamental matter, or any other liability which cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law.</strong></p>

<p><strong>18.2 If you reside in the EU, Section 18.1 does not apply, and FairlyWed Payments is liable under statutory provisions for intent and gross negligence by us, our legal representatives, directors, or other vicarious agents. The same applies to the assumption of guarantees or any other strict liability, or in case of a culpable injury to life, limb, or health. FairlyWed Payments is liable for any negligent breaches of essential contractual obligations by us, our legal representatives, directors, or other vicarious agents. Essential contractual obligations are such duties of FairlyWed Payments in whose proper fulfillment you regularly trust and must trust for the proper execution of the contract but the amount shall be limited to the typically occurring foreseeable damage. Any additional liability of FairlyWed Payments is excluded.</strong></p>

<h4></a> 19. Indemnification</h4>

<p>You agree to release, defend (at FairlyWed’s option), indemnify, and hold FairlyWed Payments and its affiliates and subsidiaries, and their officers, directors, employees, and agents, harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees, arising out of or in any way connected with (i) your breach of these Payments Terms; (ii) your improper use of the Payment Services; (iii) FairlyWed Payments’ Collection and Remittance of Occupancy Taxes; or (iv) your breach of any laws, regulations, or third-party rights.</p>

Terminating this Agreement will also serve as notice to cancel your FairlyWed Account pursuant to the FairlyWed Terms. If you cancel your FairlyWed Account as a Host, FairlyWed Payments will provide a full refund to any Guests with confirmed booking(s). If you cancel your FairlyWed Account as a Guest, FairlyWed Payments will initiate a refund for any confirmed booking(s) based on the Listing’s cancellation policy.</p>

<p>20.5 In case of non-material breaches and where appropriate, you will be given notice of any measure by FairlyWed Payments and an opportunity to resolve the issue to FairlyWed Payments' reasonable satisfaction.</p>

<p>20.6 If you are a Host and we take any of the measures described in this Section we may refund your Guests in full for any and all confirmed bookings, irrespective of preexisting cancellation policies, and you will not be entitled to any compensation for pending or confirmed bookings that were cancelled.</p>

<p>20.7 If your access to or use of the Payment Services has been limited or this Agreement has been terminated by us, you may not register a new FairlyWed Account or attempt to access and use the Payment Services through other an FairlyWed Account of another Member.</p>

Judicial proceedings (other than small claims actions) that are excluded from the Arbitration Agreement in Section 23 must be brought in state or federal court in San Francisco, California, unless we both agree to some other location. You and we both consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in San Francisco, California.</p>

<p>22.2 If you are contracting with FairlyWed China, these Payments Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of China (“<strong>China Laws</strong>”).

The arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in English. The arbitral award rendered is final and binding upon both parties.</p>

<p>22.3 If you are contracting with FairlyWed Payments UK, these Payments Terms will be interpreted in accordance with English law. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) is excluded.

If you are acting as a consumer you agree to submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts. Judicial proceedings that you are able to bring against us arising from or in connection with these Payments Terms may only be brought in a court located in England or a court with jurisdiction in your place of residence. If FairlyWed Payments wishes to enforce any of its rights against you as a consumer, we may do so only in the courts of the jurisdiction in which you are a resident. If you are acting as a business, you agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts.</p>

<p>22.4 If you are contracting with FairlyWed Payments India, these Payments Terms will be interpreted in accordance with the laws of India.

<h4></a> 23. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Agreement</h4>

<p>23.1 This Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Agreement shall apply if you (i) are contracting with FairlyWed Payments US; or (ii) bring any claim against any FairlyWed Payments entity in the United States (to the extent not in conflict with Section 22).</p>

<p>23.2 <em>Overview of Dispute Resolution Process</em>. FairlyWed Payments is committed to participating in a consumer-friendly dispute resolution process. To that end, these Payments Terms provide for a two-part process for individuals to whom Section 23.1 applies: (1) an informal negotiation directly with FairlyWed’s customer service team, and (2) a binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“<strong>AAA</strong>”) using its specially designed Consumer Arbitration Rules (as modified by this Section 23). Specifically, the process provides:</p>

<ul><li>Claims can be filed with AAA online (<a href="http://www.adr.org/" target="_blank">www.adr.org</a>);</li><li>Arbitrators must be neutral and no party may unilaterally select an arbitrator;</li><li>Arbitrators must disclose any bias, interest in the result of the arbitration, or relationship with any party;</li><li>Parties retain the right to seek relief in small claims court for certain claims, at their option;</li><li>The initial filing fee for the consumer is capped at $200;</li><li>The consumer gets to elect the hearing location and can elect to participate live, by phone, video conference, or, for claims under $25,000, by the submission of documents;</li><li>The arbitrator can grant any remedy that the parties could have received in court to resolve the party’s individual claim.</li></ul>

<p>23.3 <em>Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution and Notification</em>. Prior to initiating an arbitration, you and FairlyWed Payments each agree to notify the other party of the dispute and attempt to negotiate an informal resolution to it first. We will contact you at the email address you have provided to us; you can contact FairlyWed’s customer service team by <a href="mailto:terms@FairlyWed.com">emailing us</a>. If after a good faith effort to negotiate one of us feels the dispute has not and cannot be resolved informally, the party intending to pursue arbitration agrees to notify the other party via email prior to initiating the arbitration. In order to initiate arbitration, a claim must be filed with the AAA and the written Demand for Arbitration (available at <a href="https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Demand%20for%20Arbitration%20Consumer%20Arbitration%20Rules.pdf" target="_blank">www.adr.org</a>) provided to the other party, as specified in the AAA Rules.</p>

<p><strong>23.4 <em>Agreement to Arbitrate</em>. You and FairlyWed Payments mutually agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Payments Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement or interpretation thereof, or to the use of the Payment Services (collectively, “Disputes”) will be settled by binding arbitration (the “Arbitration Agreement”). If there is a dispute about whether this Arbitration Agreement can be enforced or applies to our Dispute, you and FairlyWed Payments agree that the arbitrator will decide that issue.</strong></p>

<p>23.5 <em>Exceptions to Arbitration Agreement</em>. You and FairlyWed Payments each agree that the following claims are exceptions to the Arbitration Agreement and will be brought in a judicial proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction: (i) Any claim related to actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights; (ii) Any claim seeking emergency injunctive relief based on exigent circumstances (e.g., imminent danger or commission of a crime, hacking, cyber-attack).</p>

<p>23.6 <em>Arbitration Rules and Governing Law</em>. This Arbitration Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. The arbitration will be administered by AAA in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “<strong>AAA Rules</strong>“) then in effect, except as modified here. The AAA Rules are available at <a href="http://www.adr.org/" target="_blank">www.adr.org</a> or by calling the AAA at 1–800–778–7879.</p>

<p>23.7 <em>Modification to AAA Rules - Arbitration Hearing/Location</em>. In order to make the arbitration most convenient to you, FairlyWed Payments agrees that any required arbitration hearing may be conducted, at your option, (a) in the county where you reside; (b) in San Francisco County; (c) in any other location to which you and FairlyWed Payments both agree; (d) via phone or video conference; or (e) for any claim or counterclaim under $25,000, by solely the submission of documents to the arbitrator.</p>

<p>23.8 <em>Modification of AAA Rules - Attorney’s Fees and Costs</em>. You may be entitled to seek an award of attorney fees and expenses if you prevail in arbitration, to the extent provided under applicable law and the AAA rules. Unless the arbitrator determines that your claim was frivolous or filed for the purpose of harassment, FairlyWed Payments agrees it will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law or the AAA rules, to recover attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.</p>

<p>23.9 <em>Arbitrator’s Decision</em>. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court with proper jurisdiction. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only on an individual basis and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim.</p>

<p><strong>23.10 <em>Jury Trial Waiver</em>. You and FairlyWed Payments acknowledge and agree that we are each waiving the right to a trial by jury as to all arbitrable Disputes.</strong></p>

<p><strong>23.11 <em>No Class Actions or Representative Proceedings</em>. You and FairlyWed Payments acknowledge and agree that we are each waiving the right to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action lawsuit, class-wide arbitration, private attorney-general action, or any other representative proceeding as to all Disputes. Further, unless you and FairlyWed Payments both otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one party’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this paragraph is held unenforceable with respect to any Dispute, then the entirety of the Arbitration Agreement will be deemed void with respect to such Dispute.</strong></p>

<p>23.12 <em>Severability</em>. Except as provided in Section 23.11, in the event that any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is deemed illegal or unenforceable, such provision shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall be given full force and effect.</p>

<p>23.13 <em>Changes</em>. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3 (“Modification of these Payments Terms”), if FairlyWed Payments changes this Section 23 (“Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Agreement”) after the date you last accepted these Payments Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Payments Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email) within thirty (30) days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Last Updated” date above or in the date of FairlyWed Payments’ email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and FairlyWed Payments in accordance with the provisions of the “Dispute Resolution” section as of the date you last accepted these Payments Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Payments Terms).</p>

<p>23.14 <em>Survival</em>. Except as provided in Section 23.12 and subject to Section 20.8, this Section 23 will survive any termination of these Payments Terms and will continue to apply even if you stop using the Payment Services or terminate your FairlyWed Account.</p>

<h4></a> 24. General Provisions</h4>

<p>24.1 Except as they may be supplemented by additional terms and conditions, policies, guidelines, or standards, these Payments Terms constitute the entire Agreement between FairlyWed Payments and you regarding the subject matter hereof, and supersede any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between FairlyWed Payments and you regarding the Payment Services.</p>

<p>24.2 No joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you or FairlyWed Payments as a result of this Agreement or your use of the Payment Services.</p>

<p>24.3 If any provision of these Payments Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision will be struck and will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions.</p>

<p>24.4 FairlyWed Payments’ failure to enforce any right or provision in these Payments Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision unless acknowledged and agreed to by us in writing. Except as expressly set forth in these Payments Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Payments Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Payments Terms or otherwise permitted under law.</p>

<p>24.5 You may not assign, transfer, or delegate this Agreement and your rights and obligations hereunder without FairlyWed Payments’ prior written consent. FairlyWed Payments may without restriction assign, transfer, or delegate this Agreement and any rights and obligations, at its sole discretion, with thirty (30) days’ prior notice (or two (2) months’ prior notice for Members contracting with FairlyWed Payments UK). Your right to terminate this Agreement at any time remains unaffected.</p>

<p>24.6 This Agreement does not and is not intended to confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than the parties.

<p>25.1.2 By agreeing to these Payments Terms you as Host have consented to FairlyWed Payments UK’s payment of each Payout to your chosen Payout Method. Hosts may change a Payout Method up to one (1) day before the time agreed for the Payout as set out in Section 7.2.

<p>25.1.3 FairlyWed Payments UK will endeavor to ensure that Hosts based in the EEA will receive each Payout by the end of the business day following FairlyWed Payments UK’s initiation of the Payout.</p>

<h5>25.3 Resolution Procedures for Diverted Payouts</h5>

<p>25.3.1 If you as a Host believe that a Payout properly due to you has been or may be diverted without your permission (“<strong>Diverted Payout</strong>”) because your password or other credentials to log into your FairlyWed Account (“<strong>Credentials</strong>”) are lost or stolen, you should notify FairlyWed Payments UK pursuant to Section 26 immediately. As a Host you may be liable for losses relating to any Diverted Payout arising from the use of lost, stolen, or misappropriated Credentials (including the loss of a mobile phone on which you have installed the Application) or where you have failed to keep your Credentials safe, up to a maximum of £50. Provided that you notify us of any Diverted Payout without delay and at the very latest within 13 months of the date of the payment, you may be entitled to a refund of that payment.</p>

<p>25.3.2 We will not be liable for any loss arising from: (i) Diverted Payouts where you acted fraudulently or where, with intent or gross negligence, you failed to use the FairlyWed Platform and/or Payment Services in accordance with the FairlyWed Terms or these Payments Terms (including the obligation to keep your Credentials safe); (ii) or any payout transaction which we facilitated in accordance with information provided by you where the information you provided was incorrect.</p>

<p>25.3.3 If you as Host claim not to have received a Payout properly due to you via your chosen Payout Method, FairlyWed Payments UK will (if requested) make immediate efforts to trace the payment and will notify you of the outcome.

  <li><strong>Financial Terms for Bookings</strong>

    <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">
      <li><em>Key Definitions</em>

        <p>“<strong>Payment Method</strong>” means a payment method that you have added to your FairlyWed Account, such as a credit card, debit card or PayPal.</p>

        <p>“<strong>Payout Method</strong>” means a payout method that you have added to your FairlyWed Account, such as PayPal, direct deposit or electronic funds transfer, a prepaid card or a debit card (where available).</p>

      </li>
      <li><em>Financial Terms for Hosts regarding Bookings</em>

        <p>If, as a Host, you are unable to confirm or decide to reject a Booking request within the Booking Request Period, any amounts collected by FairlyWed Payments for the requested Booking will be refunded to the applicable Guest’s Payment Method and any pre-authorization of such Payment Method will be released.</p>

        <p>FairlyWed Payments will collect the Total Fees from each Guest either at the time of the Booking request or upon the Host’s confirmation of the Booking (depending upon the Guest’s Payment Method). FairlyWed Payments will initiate payment of the Accommodation Fees (less FairlyWed’s Host Fees and any Taxes in respect of the Host Fees, such as VAT in Europe) to the Host in most cases within 24 hours of the scheduled check-in time for the Guest at the applicable Accommodation (or within 24 hours of 3:00pm local time - or 3:00pm UTC if local time is unknown - if the check-in time is flexible or not specified), unless the Host and FairlyWed Payments agree to a different time or trigger for payment. The time it takes for the Host to receive payouts once released by FairlyWed Payments may depend upon the Payout Method chosen by the Host. Some Payout Methods involve the use of third-party payment processors, who may impose their own additional charges for the use of their services on the Host, including by deducting their charges from the payout amount.</p>

        <p>If you owe or agree to pay any amount via FairlyWed Payments to FairlyWed (whether as a result of your Bookings or actions as a Guest or otherwise), then FairlyWed Payments may (but is not obliged to) withhold the amount owing to FairlyWed from any payout amounts due to you as a Host, and use the withheld amount to setoff the amount owed by you to FairlyWed. If FairlyWed Payments does so, then your obligation to pay FairlyWed will be extinguished to the extent of the amount withheld by FairlyWed Payments, and FairlyWed will cease to owe to you any obligations (including, but not limited to, any obligation to pay you) with respect to the amount withheld. In addition to the amount due, if your account is delinquent or you otherwise have chargebacks on your account, you may be charged fees that are incidental to our collection of these delinquent amounts and chargebacks. Such fees or charges may include collection fees, convenience fees, or other third party charges. You hereby explicitly agree that all communication in relation to delinquent accounts will be made by electronic mail or by phone, as provided to FairlyWed and/or FairlyWed Payments by you. Such communication may be made by FairlyWed, FairlyWed Payments or by anyone on their behalf, including but not limited to a third party collection agent.</p>

      </li>
      <li><em>Appointment of FairlyWed Payments as Limited Payment Collection Agent for Host</em>

        <p>Each Host hereby appoints FairlyWed Payments as the Host’s limited payment collection agent solely for the purpose of accepting the Accommodation Fees from Guests.</p>

        <p>Each Host agrees that payment made by a Guest through FairlyWed Payments, shall be considered the same as a payment made directly to the Host, and the Host will make the Accommodation available to the Guest in the agreed-upon manner as if the Host has received the Accommodation Fees. Each Host agrees that FairlyWed Payments may, in accordance with the cancellation policy selected by the Host and reflected in the relevant Listing, refund to the Guest that portion of the Accommodation Fees specified in the applicable cancellation policy. Each Host understands that FairlyWed Payments accepts payments from Guests as the Host’s limited payment collection agent and that FairlyWed Payments’ obligation to pay the Host is subject to and conditional upon successful receipt of the associated payments from Guests. FairlyWed Payments does not guarantee payments to Hosts for amounts that have not been successfully received by FairlyWed Payments from Guests. In accepting appointment as the limited collection agent of the Host, FairlyWed Payments assumes no liability for any acts or omissions of the Host.</p>

      </li>
      <li><em>Financial Terms for Guests regarding Bookings</em>

        <p>You acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding the fact that FairlyWed Payments is not a party to the agreement between you and the Host, FairlyWed Payments acts as the Host’s payment collection agent for the limited purpose of accepting payments from you on behalf of the Host. Upon your payment of the Total Fees to FairlyWed Payments, your payment obligation to the Host for the Accommodation Fees is extinguished, and FairlyWed Payments is responsible for remitting the Accommodation Fees (less the Host Fees and any Taxes in respect of the Host Fees, such as VAT in Europe), in the manner described in these Payments Terms. In the event that FairlyWed Payments does not remit any such amounts as described in these Payments Terms, such Host will have recourse only against such FairlyWed Payments entity.</p>

        <p>You as a Guest agree that FairlyWed Payments may charge your Payment Method the Total Fees for any Booking requested in connection with your FairlyWed Account. In order to establish a Booking pending the applicable Host’s confirmation of your requested Booking, you understand and agree that FairlyWed Payments, on behalf of the Host, reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to (i) obtain a pre-authorization via your Payment Method for the Total Fees or (ii) charge your Payment Method a nominal amount, not to exceed one dollar ($1), or a similar sum in the currency in which you are transacting (e.g. one euro or one British pound), to verify your Payment Method. As a general rule, FairlyWed Payments will collect the Total Fees due once FairlyWed receives confirmation of your Booking from the applicable Host. However, if you pay with a push Payment Method (such as Alipay or Sofort), FairlyWed Payments will collect Total Fees at the time of your Booking request. In instances in which FairlyWed Payments is unable to collect Total Fees in the ordinary course, FairlyWed Payments may elect to collect Total Fees at a later point in time. Once the payment transaction for your requested Booking is successfully completed you will receive a confirmation email summarizing your confirmed Booking.</p>

        <p>If a requested Booking is cancelled (i.e. not confirmed by the applicable Host), any amounts collected by FairlyWed Payments will be refunded to such Guest, depending on the selections the Guest makes via the Site and Application, and any pre-authorization of such Guest’s Payment Method will be released, if applicable. The timing to receive such refund or for a pre-authorization to be released will be determined based on the Payment Method used and any applicable payment system (e.g., Visa, MasterCard, etc.) rules.</p>

        <p>In connection with your requested Booking, you will be asked to provide customary billing information such as name, billing address and Payment Method information either to FairlyWed Payments or its third-party payment processor(s). You agree to pay FairlyWed Payments for any confirmed Bookings made in connection with your FairlyWed Account in accordance with these Payments Terms by one of the methods supported by the Site or Application (e.g. by PayPal, credit card or debit card). You hereby authorize the collection of such amounts by charging the Payment Method provided as part of requesting the Booking, either directly by FairlyWed Payments or indirectly, via a third-party online payment processor or by one of the payment methods described on the Site or Application. You also authorize FairlyWed Payments to charge any Payment Method on file in your FairlyWed Account in the event of damage caused at an Accommodation as contemplated under Section 8, “Damage to Accommodations and Security Deposits”, below.</p>

        <p>If FairlyWed Payments is unable to collect any amounts you owe for a confirmed Booking or a Damage Claim, FairlyWed Payments may engage in collection efforts to recover such amounts from you. You hereby explicitly agree that all communication in relation to amounts owed will be made by electronic mail or by phone, as provided to FairlyWed and/or FairlyWed Payments by you. Such communication may be made by FairlyWed, FairlyWed Payments or by anyone on their behalf, including but not limited to a third party collection agent.</p>

        <p>Please note that FairlyWed Payments cannot control any fees that may be charged to a Guest by his or her third-party payment service provider related to FairlyWed Payments’ collection of the Total Fees, and FairlyWed Payments disclaims all liability in this regard. Whatever Payment Method you use may be subject to additional terms and conditions imposed by the applicable third-party payment service provider; please review such terms and conditions before using your Payment Method.</p>

      </li>
      <li><em>Service Fees and Other Fees</em>

        <p>FairlyWed Payments collects the Service Fees charged by FairlyWed pursuant to the <a href="/terms"><em>FairlyWed Terms</em></a>. Where applicable, FairlyWed may also charge Taxes (such as VAT in Europe) in respect of the Host Fees and Guest Fees. FairlyWed Payments deducts the Host Fees from the Accommodation Fees before remitting the balance to the Host as described in these Payments Terms. Guest Fees are, as noted above, included in the Total Fees.</p>

        <p>Balances will be remitted by FairlyWed Payments to Hosts via the Payout Method selected by the Host in the Host’s currency of choice, depending upon the selections the Host makes via the Site, Application and Services. Amounts may be rounded up or down as described the “Rounding Off” portion of this Section 6.</p>

        <p>Please note that FairlyWed Payments may impose or deduct currency conversion costs on or from any payments or payouts by FairlyWed in currencies other than U.S. dollars. More information on any such costs or deductions is available via the Site and Application, and in Section 10, “Currency Conversion”, below. More information on Services Fees can be found at <a href="/help"><em>www.FairlyWed.com/help</em></a>. Except as otherwise provided herein, Service Fees are non-refundable.</p>

      </li>
      <li><em>General Booking and Financial Terms</em>

        <p><em>Cancellations and Refunds</em></p>

        <p>If, as a Guest, you cancel your requested Booking before the requested Booking is confirmed by a Host, FairlyWed Payments will cancel any pre-authorization to your Payment Method and/or refund any nominal amounts charged to your Payment Method in connection with the requested Booking within a commercially reasonable time. If, as a Guest, you wish to cancel a confirmed Booking made via the Site, Application and Services, either prior to or after arriving at the Accommodation, FairlyWed Payments will refund the Accommodation Fees, Guest Fees and any other amounts charged to you only as permitted under the <a href="/terms"><em>FairlyWed Terms</em></a>, including the terms of the applicable cancellation policy.</p>

        <p>If a Host cancels a confirmed Booking made via the Site, Application or Services, FairlyWed Payments will refund the Total Fees for such Booking to the applicable Guest within a commercially reasonable time of the cancellation. If the Guest requests to book an alternative Listing and the Host associated with such alternative Listing confirms the Guest’s requested Booking, then FairlyWed Payments will collect the Total Fees relating to the confirmed Booking for the Accommodation in the alternative Listing, in accordance with these Payments Terms.</p>

        <p>If, as a Host, you cancel a confirmed Booking, you agree that FairlyWed Payments may collect any cancellation fees imposed pursuant to the <a href="/terms"><em>FairlyWed Terms</em></a>. FairlyWed Payments will treat your cancellation as a payment authorization, and FairlyWed Payments may withhold any cancellation fees from your future payouts or charged to any Payment Method on file in your FairlyWed Account.</p>

        <p>If FairlyWed decides for any reason that it is necessary or desirable to cancel a confirmed Booking made via the Site, Application and Services pursuant to the <a href="/terms"><em>FairlyWed Terms</em></a>, <a href="/terms/guest_refund_policy"><em>Guest Refund Policy</em></a> or <a href="/help/article/934/what-extenuating-circumstances-are-eligible-for-a-refund?cref=50600db5c"><em>Extenuating Circumstances Policy</em></a>, you agree that FairlyWed Payments and the relevant Guest or Host will not have any liability for such cancellations or refunds.</p>

        <p>If, as a Host, your Guest cancels a confirmed Booking or FairlyWed decides that it is necessary to cancel a confirmed Booking, and FairlyWed issues a refund to the Guest in accordance with the <a href="/terms/guest_refund_policy"><em>Guest Refund Policy</em></a>, <a href="/help/article/934/what-extenuating-circumstances-are-eligible-for-a-refund?cref=50600db5c"><em>Extenuating Circumstances Policy</em></a> or other applicable cancellation policies, you agree that in the event you have already been paid, FairlyWed Payments will be entitled to recover the amount of any such refund from you, including by subtracting such refund amount out from any future Accommodation Fees due to you.</p>

        <p><em>Resolution Center</em></p>

        <p>Each Member agrees that FairlyWed Payments may collect from you any amount paid through the Resolution Center in connection with your FairlyWed Account by charging the Payment Method associated with the relevant Booking or any other Payment Method on file in your FairlyWed Account, or by withholding the amount from your future payouts. FairlyWed Payments will process such payments otherwise in accordance with these Payments Terms.</p>

        <p>Each Member collecting payment for services or amenities via the Resolution Center hereby appoints FairlyWed Payments as that Member’s limited payment collection agent solely for the purpose of accepting funds from another Member for the purchase of services or amenities via the Resolution Center. Each Member agrees that payment made by a purchasing Member via the Resolution Center through FairlyWed Payments, shall be considered the same as a payment made directly to the Member, and the Member will make the service(s) or amenity(ies) available to the purchasing Member in the agreed-upon manner as if the Member has received the payment. Each Member understands that FairlyWed Payments accepts payments from purchasing Members as the Member’s limited payment collection agent and that FairlyWed Payments’ obligation to pay the Member is subject to and conditional upon successful receipt of the associated payments from purchasing Members. FairlyWed Payments does not guarantee payments to Members for amounts that have not been successfully received by FairlyWed Payments from purchasing Members. In accepting appointment as the limited payment collection agent of the Member, FairlyWed Payments assumes no liability for any acts or omissions of the Member.</p>

        <p>If you are paying for services or amenities via the Resolution Center, you acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding the fact that FairlyWed Payments is not a party to the agreement between you and the Member providing the service(s) or amenity(ies), FairlyWed Payments acts as the other Member’s payment collection agent for the limited purpose of accepting payments from you on behalf of the Member. Upon your payment of the funds to FairlyWed Payments, your payment obligation to the Member providing the service(s) or amenity(ies) for the agreed upon amount is extinguished, and FairlyWed Payments is responsible for remitting the funds, in the manner described in these Payments Terms. In the event that FairlyWed Payments does not remit any such amounts as described in these Payments Terms, such Member will have recourse only against such FairlyWed Payments entity.</p>

        <p><em>Recurring Payments</em></p>

        <p>For certain Bookings, Guests may be required to make recurring, incremental payments toward the Total Fees owed for a confirmed Booking before beginning his or her stay at the applicable Accommodation (collectively, “<strong>Recurring Payments</strong>”). More information on Recurring Payments (including the amount and the frequency of the payment) will be made available via the Site, Application and Services, if applicable. If Recurring Payments apply to a confirmed Booking, then the Guest authorizes FairlyWed Payments, on behalf of the Host, to collect the Total Fees and the Host agrees that FairlyWed Payments will initiate payouts to the Host, in the increments and at the frequency associated with the applicable Recurring Payments, each as identified on the Site, Application and Services. You may stop payment of a Recurring Payment by notifying FairlyWed Payments orally or in writing at least three (3) business days before the scheduled date of the payment. FairlyWed Payments may require that you give written confirmation of a stop-payment order within fourteen (14) days of an oral notification. If you fail to provide written confirmation within fourteen (14) days as requested, FairlyWed Payments is not obligated to honor your request to stop any future Recurring Payments. If you have any questions regarding your Recurring Payments, please contact FairlyWed Payments pursuant to Section 34.</p>

        <p><em>Rounding Off</em></p>

        <p>FairlyWed Payments may, in its sole discretion, round up or round down amounts that are payable from or to Guests or Hosts to the nearest whole functional base unit in which the currency is denominated (e.g. to the nearest dollar, euro or other supported currency); for example, FairlyWed Payments will round up an amount of $101.50 to $102.00, and $101.49 to $101.00.</p>

        <p>Some currencies are denominated in large numbers. In those cases, FairlyWed Payments may determine the functional base unit in which those currencies are denominated to be 10, 100 or 1,000 of the currency; the corresponding examples for such currencies would be for FairlyWed Payments to round up an amount of 1,045 up to 1,050 and 1,044 down to 1,040, or 35,450 up to 35,500 and 35,449 down to 35,400, or 837,500 up to 838,000 and 837,499 down to 837,000.</p>

        <p><em>Payment Processing Errors</em></p>

        <p>We will take steps to rectify any payment processing errors that we become aware of. These steps may include crediting or debiting (as appropriate) the same Payout Method or Payment Method used for the original payout to or payment by you, so that you end up receiving or paying the correct amount.</p>

        <p><em>Booking Modifications</em></p>

        <p>If, as a Guest, you owe additional amounts to FairlyWed due to a Booking Modification, you agree that FairlyWed Payments may collect such amounts by charging the Payment Method used to make your Booking. If, as a Host, you owe FairlyWed any amounts due to a Booking Modification, you agree that FairlyWed Payments may collect those amounts pursuant to the “Financial Terms for Hosts regarding Bookings” portion of this Section 6 and as otherwise permitted under these Payments Terms.</p>

        <p>Whether you are a Guest or Host, you agree that any claim or cause of action relating to FairlyWed Payments’ facilitation of Opt-in for Host Remittance or Collection and Remittance shall not extend to any supplier or vendor that may be used by FairlyWed in connection with facilitation of Opt-in Remittance or Collection and Remittance of Occupancy Taxes, if any. Guests and Hosts agree that we may seek additional amounts from you in the event that the Taxes collected and/or remitted are insufficient to fully discharge your obligations to the Tax Authority, and agree that your sole remedy for Occupancy Taxes collected is a refund of Occupancy Taxes collected by FairlyWed from the applicable Tax Authority in accordance with applicable procedures set by that Tax Authority.</p>

        <p>In any jurisdiction in which we have not provided notice of, or are not facilitating (or are no longer facilitating), the collection or remittance of Occupancy Taxes by Collection and Remittance, Opt-in for Host Remittance or any other means or method, in your jurisdiction, Hosts and Guests remain solely responsible and liable for the collection and/or remittance of any and all Occupancy Taxes that may apply to Accommodations.</p>

        <p>Hosts and Guests acknowledge and agree that in some jurisdictions, FairlyWed Payments may decide not to facilitate collection or remittance of Occupancy Taxes or may not be able to facilitate the collection and/or remittance of Occupancy Taxes, and nothing contained in these Payments Terms is a representation or guarantee that FairlyWed Payments will facilitate collection and/or remittance of Occupancy Tax anywhere at all, including in any specific jurisdiction, or that FairlyWed Payments will continue to facilitate any collection or remittance of Occupancy Tax in any specific jurisdiction in which it may have been offered. FairlyWed Payments reserves the right, in its sole determination, to cease any facilitation of any collection and remittance of Occupancy Tax (regardless of method used or to be used in the future) for any reason or no reason at all, provided that it will give Hosts reasonable notice in any jurisdiction in which FairlyWed Payments determines to cease any such facilitation.</p>

      </li></ol></li>
  <li><strong>Damage to Accommodations and Security Deposits</strong>

    <p>If (i) you as a Guest agree to pay the Host in connection with a Damage Claim, or (ii) FairlyWed determines that you are responsible for damaging an Accommodation or any personal or other property located at an Accommodation pursuant to the <a href="/terms"><em>FairlyWed Terms</em></a>, FairlyWed Payments may charge the Payment Method used to make the Booking in order to collect any Security Deposit associated with the Listing, as well as any amount of the Damage Claim exceeding any Security Deposit. If the Listing does not have a Security Deposit, FairlyWed Payments may charge the Payment Method used to make the Booking for the amount of the Damage Claim. If we are unable to collect from your Payment Method used to make the Booking, you agree that FairlyWed Payments may charge any other Payment Method on file in your FairlyWed Account at the time of the Damage Claim.</p>

    <p>FairlyWed Payments also reserves the right to otherwise collect payment from you and pursue any avenues available to FairlyWed Payments if FairlyWed determines that you have damaged any Accommodation or any personal or other property located at any Accommodation. If we are unable to charge a Payment Method on file in your FairlyWed Account or otherwise collect payment from you, you agree to remit payment for any damage to the Accommodation to the applicable Host or to FairlyWed Payments (if applicable).</p>

    <p>Security Deposits, if required by a Host, may be applied to any fees due from a Guest overstaying at a Listing without the Host’s consent.</p>

  </li>
  <li><strong>Overstaying without the Host’s Consent</strong>

    <p>If you as a Guest stay past the agreed upon checkout time without the Host’s consent, you agree that FairlyWed Payments, in its role as limited payment collection agent for the Host, may charge any Payment Method(s) you have on file in your FairlyWed Account to collect, for each 24 hour period that the Guest stays over the agreed period without the Host’s consent, an additional nightly fee of two times the average nightly Accommodation Fee originally paid by the Guest to cover the inconvenience suffered by the Host, plus all applicable Service Fees, Taxes, and any legal expenses incurred by the Host to make the Guest leave (collectively, “<strong>Additional Sums</strong>”). In addition, FairlyWed Payments may recover any costs and expenses it incurs in collecting the Additional Sums by charging any Payment Method(s) you have on file in your FairlyWed Account.</p>

  </li>
  <li><strong>Currency Conversion</strong>

    <p><em>Key Definitions</em></p>

    <p>“<strong>Booking Currency</strong>” means the currency in which a Guest has to pay for his or her Booking. At the time the Guest submits a Booking request, the FairlyWed platform will select the Booking Currency, based on the Guest’s country of origin as determined by (i) FairlyWed’s platform logic; (ii) the Payment Method associated with the Booking; or (iii) both. FairlyWed supports only a certain number of currencies as Booking Currencies. The Booking Currency for a Booking may be different from the relevant Listing Currency.</p>

    <p>“<strong>Listing Currency</strong>” means the default currency associated with the country in which the Listing is located. For example, the Listing Currency for a home located in New York would be U.S. dollars, and the Listing Currency for a home located in Japan would be Japanese Yen.</p>

    <p>“<strong>Base Exchange Rate</strong>” means a system-wide rate used by FairlyWed for currency conversion that is in effect at the time the currency conversion is processed, and does not include any fee or mark-up by FairlyWed. FairlyWed establishes the Base Exchange Rate using data from one or more third parties such as OANDA (<a href="http://www.oanda.com/"><em>www.oanda.com</em></a>).</p>

    <p>“<strong>Adjusted Exchange Rate</strong>” means a rate for currency conversion that is calculated by adding a mark-up to the Base Exchange Rate. This mark-up represents a charge imposed by FairlyWed for its holding costs and foreign currency risks.</p>

    <p>Each currency conversion is processed at a currency conversion rate. This rate generally refers to the amount of one currency that must be paid to buy a certain amount of another currency at a given time. For example, if it costs US$125.00 to buy €100.00, the currency conversion rate of U.S. dollars to Euros would be 1.25, and the currency conversion rate from Euros to U.S. dollars would be 0.8. Currency conversion rates will vary from time to time.</p>

    <p>FairlyWed Payments will process a currency conversion in the following situations:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Where the Booking Currency is different from the Listing Currency when a Guest submits a booking request for a Listing, FairlyWed will calculate the Total Fees in the Booking Currency by applying either the Base Exchange Rate or the Adjusted Exchange Rate at the time of the Booking request to the Total Fees in the Listing Currency. The Guest Fee, which is a percentage of the applicable Accommodation Fees, will be calculated based on the Accommodation Fees in the Booking Currency (i.e. after conversion from the Listing Currency). The Adjusted Exchange Rate will be applied if the Booking Currency is different from the Listing Currency.</li>
      <li>When a confirmed Booking is modified or cancelled, and there had been a currency conversion when the Booking was submitted, the currency conversion for any additional payments required of the Guest or any refund to the Guest will be processed at the same rate as applied to the earlier payment by the Guest.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>When you as a Guest submit a Booking request for a Listing, you will be able to view the actual exchange rate used to calculate the Total Fees in the Booking Currency. Where the Adjusted Exchange Rate is applied, the exchange rate will be displayed inclusive of the mark-up. The exchange rate (and any mark-up included in the rate) will also be stated in the billing receipt for your Booking.</p>

  </li>
  <li><strong>Payment Method Information</strong>

  <li><strong>FairlyWed Payments Contracting Entity</strong>

    <p>Generally speaking, the FairlyWed Payments entity with whom you are contracting for the purposes of the Payment Services will be determined for each payment or payout based on the jurisdiction in which the relevant Payment Method or Payout Method was issued. The jurisdictions and the corresponding FairlyWed Payments contracting entity are set forth below:</p>
    <table class="table"><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><em><strong>Jurisdiction</strong></em></td><td><em><strong>Local Contracting Entity</strong></em></td></tr><tr class="even"><td>United States</td><td>FairlyWed Payments, Inc.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>China</td><td>FairlyWed China</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>India</td><td>FairlyWed Payments India Pvt. Ltd.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>All others</td><td>FairlyWed Payments UK Ltd.</td></tr></tbody></table>

    <ul>
      <li>if you use a Payment Method or Payout Method issued in China and book an Accommodation or create a Listing outside of China, or book an Accommodation in China with a Host who is not a resident of China, you are contracting with FairlyWed Payments UK Ltd. related to that activity;</li>
      <li>if you use a Payout Method issued in India and accept a Booking from a Guest with a Payment Method that is not issued in India, you are contracting with FairlyWed Payments UK Ltd. for that Booking; and</li>
      <li>if you use a Payment Method or Payout Method issued in any jurisdiction other than the United States or India and are not contracting with FairlyWed China, you are contracting with FairlyWed Payments UK Ltd.</li>

  </li>
  <li><strong>Controlling Law and Jurisdiction</strong>

    <p>These Payments Terms and your use of the Payment Services will be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California and the United States of America, without regard to its conflict-of-law provisions. You and we agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of a state court located in San Francisco County, San Francisco, California or a United States District Court, Northern District of California located in San Francisco, California for any actions for which the parties <strong>retain the right to seek</strong> injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights, <strong>as set forth in Section 28, “Dispute Resolution”, below</strong>.</p>

  </li>
  <li><strong>Dispute Resolution</strong>

    <p>You and FairlyWed Payments agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Payments Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, or to the use of the Services or use of the Site or Application (collectively, “<strong>Disputes</strong>”) will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights. <strong>You acknowledge and agree that you and FairlyWed Payments are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action lawsuit, class-wide arbitration, private attorney-general action, or any other representative proceeding.</strong> Further, unless both you and FairlyWed Payments otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this “Dispute Resolution” section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this “Dispute Resolution” section will survive any termination of these Payments Terms.</p>

    <p><em>Arbitration Rules and Governing Law.</em> This agreement to arbitrate evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“<strong>AAA</strong>”) in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “<strong>AAA Rules</strong>”) then in effect, except as modified by this “Dispute Resolution” section. (The AAA Rules are available at <a href="http://www.adr.org/"><em>www.adr.org</em></a> or by calling the AAA at +1 800 778 7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this section.</p>

    <p><em>Arbitration Process.</em> A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a <a href="https://www.adr.org/cs/idcplg?IdcService=GET_FILE&amp;dDocName=ADRSTAGE2034889&amp;RevisionSelectionMethod=LatestReleased"><em>form Demand for Arbitration</em></a>.) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.</p>

    <p><em>Arbitration Location and Procedure.</em> Unless you and FairlyWed Payments otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and FairlyWed Payments submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.</p>

    <p><em>Arbitrator’s Decision.</em> The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator’s award damages must be consistent with the terms of Section 19, “Limitation of Liability”, above, as to the types and the amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. FairlyWed will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.</p>

    <p><em>Fees.</em> Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, FairlyWed Payments will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).</p>

    <p><em>Changes.</em> Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2, “Modification”, above, if FairlyWed Payments changes this “Dispute Resolution” section after the date you last accepted these Payments Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Payments Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Last Updated” date above or in the date of FairlyWed Payments’ email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and FairlyWed Payments in accordance with the provisions of this “Dispute Resolution” section as of the date you last accepted these Payments Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Payments Terms).</p>

  </li>
  <li><strong>General</strong>

    <p>The failure of FairlyWed Payments to enforce any right or provision of these Payments Terms will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision.

  <li><strong>Additional Clauses for Users Contracting with FairlyWed Payments UK Ltd.</strong>

    <p>The following paragraphs will apply if you are contracting with FairlyWed Payments UK Ltd. (“<strong>FairlyWed Payments UK</strong>”):</p>

    <p><em>Payment Service User</em></p>

    <p>The Payment Services include the payment collection service provided to Hosts contracting with FairlyWed Payments UK. The payment collection service constitutes a “payment service” regulated under the Payment Services Regulations and for these purposes FairlyWed Payments UK treats Hosts as the “payment service user.”</p>

    <p>Hosts must create a Payout Method with FairlyWed Payments UK via the Site or Application by providing complete and accurate information as follows:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>For direct deposit/electronic funds transfer, your address, name on the account, account type, routing number and account number;</li>
      <li>For PayPal, your address, email address, and payout currency; and</li>
      <li>For Payoneer prepaid debit cards, your address and Payoneer account information.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>By agreeing to these Payments Terms you as Host have consented to FairlyWed Payments UK’s payment of the Accommodation Fees (less FairlyWed's Host Fees and any Taxes in respect of the Host Fees, such as VAT in Europe) to your chosen Payout Method. Hosts may change a Payout Method up to 1 day before the time agreed for payment as set out in Section 6.B. FairlyWed Payments UK will be deemed to have received the Host's payment order to the Host on the same date FairlyWed Payments UK agrees to initiate payment in accordance with Section 6.B.</p>

    <p>FairlyWed Payments UK will endeavor to ensure that Hosts based in the EEA will receive payment of Accommodation Fees (less FairlyWed's Host Fees and any Taxes in respect of the Host Fees, such as VAT in Europe) by the end of the business day following FairlyWed Payments UK’s initiation of the payment.</p>

    <p><em>Communication</em></p>

    <p>FairlyWed Payments will provide the Host notice via email when we initiate each payout transaction. We will also provide notice if the payout is returned to us because of an error. FairlyWed Payments will use the email address related to your FairlyWed Account. It is your responsibility as a Host to ensure that you provide us with a current, accurate and valid email address.</p>

    <p><em>Resolution Procedures for Diverted Payouts</em></p>

    <p>If you as a Host believe that a payout properly due to you has been or may be diverted without your permission (“<strong>Diverted Payout</strong>”) because your password or other credentials to log into your FairlyWed Account (“<strong>Credentials</strong>”) are lost or stolen, you should notify FairlyWed Payments UK pursuant to Section 34 immediately. As a Host you may be liable for losses relating to any Diverted Payout arising from the use of lost, stolen or misappropriated Credentials (including the loss of a mobile phone on which you have installed the Application) or where you have failed to keep your Credentials safe, up to a maximum of £50. Provided that you notify us of any Diverted Payout without delay and at the very latest within 13 months of the date of the payment, you may be entitled to a refund of that payment.</p>

    <p>We will not be liable for any loss arising from: (i) Diverted Payouts where you acted fraudulently or where, with intent or gross negligence, you failed to use the Site, Application, Services and/or Payment Services in accordance with the FairlyWed Terms or these Payments Terms (including the obligation to keep your Credentials safe); (ii) or any payout transaction which we facilitated in accordance with information provided by you where the information you provided was incorrect.</p>

    <p>If you as Host claim not to have received a payout properly due to you via your chosen Payout Method, FairlyWed Payments UK will (if requested) make immediate efforts to trace the payment and will notify you of the outcome. Unless we can prove that the payment was received by you via your chosen Payout Method, we will refund the amount.</p>

    <p>Section 6.D, “<strong>Financial Terms for Guests regarding Bookings</strong>”, shall be amended by adding the following: “<em>You acknowledge that if your FairlyWed Account is located in Brazil and you are paying by credit card, you may pay for your Booking in multiple installments as long as your credit card supports installments and is issued in Brazil. The number of installments may vary, but will be presented to you before you complete your Booking transaction. You also acknowledge that the Total Fees may be increased in case you choose to pay for your Booking using credit card installments.</em>”</p>
