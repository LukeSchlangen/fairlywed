  purchasing such services (“<strong>Purchasing Members</strong>”).</p>

<p>9.2 Each Providing Member agrees that payment made by a Purchasing Member through FairlyWed, shall be considered the same
  as a payment made directly to the Providing Member, and the Providing Member will provide the purchased services to the
  Purchasing Member in the agreed-upon manner as if the Providing Member has received the payment directly from the Purchasing
  Member. Each Providing Member agrees that FairlyWed may refund the Purchasing Member in accordance with the FairlyWed Terms.
  Each Providing Member understands that FairlyWed’ obligation to pay the Providing Member is subject to and conditional
  upon successful receipt of the associated payments from Purchasing Members. FairlyWed guarantees payments to Providing

  in accordance with these Payments Terms.</p>

<h5>10.4 Rounding Off</h5>

<p>10.4.1 FairlyWed may, in its sole discretion, round up or round down amounts that are payable from or to Members to the nearest
  whole functional base unit in which the currency is denominated (i.e., to the nearest dollar, euro or other supported currency);
  for example, FairlyWed may round up an amount of $101.50 to $102.00, and round down an amount of $101.49 to $101.00.</p>

<p>10.4.2 For currencies denominated in large numbers, FairlyWed may determine the functional base unit in which those currencies
  are denominated to be 10, 100 or 1,000 of the currency; the corresponding examples for such currencies would be for FairlyWed
  to round up an amount of 1,045 up to 1,050 and 1,044 down to 1,040, or 35,450 up to 35,500 and 35,449 down to 35,400, or
  837,500 up to 838,000 and 837,499 down to 837,000.</p>

<p>We will take steps to rectify any payment processing errors that we become aware of. These steps may include crediting or
  debiting (as appropriate) the same Payout Method or Payment Method used for the original Payout to or payment by you, so
  that you end up receiving or paying the correct amount.</p>

<h5>10.6 Booking Modifications</h5>

<p>If, as a Client, you owe additional amounts to FairlyWed due to a Booking Modification, you agree that FairlyWed may collect
  such amounts by charging the Payment Method used to make your booking (or, if that Payment Method is not available, through
  any other authorized Payment Method in your FairlyWed Account). If, as a Vendor, you owe FairlyWed any amounts due to a
  Booking Modification, you agree that FairlyWed may collect those amounts pursuant to Section 7 (“Financial Terms for Vendors”)
  and as otherwise permitted under these Payments Terms.</p>

<h5>10.7 Collections</h5>

<p>If FairlyWed is unable to collect any amounts you owe under these Payments Terms, FairlyWed may engage in collection efforts
  to recover such amounts from you. FairlyWed will deem any owed amounts overdue when: (a) for authorized charges, ninety
  (90) days have elapsed after FairlyWed first attempts to charge the Member’s Payment Method or the associated services
  have been provided, whichever is later; and (b) for withholdings from a Vendor’s future Payouts, one hundred and eighty
  (180) days have elapsed after the adjustment is made to the Vendor’s account or the associated services have been provided,
  whichever is later. Any overdue amounts not collected within one hundred and eighty (180) days after they become overdue
  will be deemed to be in default. You hereby explicitly agree that all communication in relation to amounts owed will be
  made by electronic mail or by phone, as provided to FairlyWed and/or FairlyWed by you. Such communication may be made by
  FairlyWed, FairlyWed, or by anyone on their behalf, including but not limited to a third-party collection agent.</p>

<h4>11. Taxes</h4>

<p>FairlyWed does not generally collect Taxes as the services provided do not warrant taxation. If there is a situation where
  additional taxes are required, the Vendor is responsible for paying the entirety of the appropriate taxes. For example,
  if there is an exchange of a physical entity (e.g. a hard drive or flash drive with images from a photography Vendor),
  sales tax may be a requirement.</p>

<h4>12. Damage to Accommodations and Security Deposits</h4>

<p>12.1 If you as a Client (i) agree to pay the Vendor in connection with a Damage Claim, or (ii) FairlyWed determines that
  you are responsible for damaging the property of a Vendor, you authorize FairlyWed to charge the Payment Method used to
  make the booking in order to collect any Security Deposit associated with the Listing, as well as any amount of the Damage
  Claim exceeding any Security Deposit. If the Listing does not have a Security Deposit, FairlyWed may charge the Payment
  Method used to make the booking for the amount of the Damage Claim. If we are unable to collect from your Payment Method
  used to make the booking, you agree that FairlyWed may charge any other Payment Method on file (and not otherwise unauthorized)
  in your FairlyWed Account at the time of the Damage Claim.</p>

<p>12.2 FairlyWed also reserves the right to otherwise collect payment from you and pursue any remedies available to FairlyWed
  in situations in which you are responsible for a Damage Claim.</p>

<h4>13. Currency Conversion</h4>

<p>13.1 FairlyWed will do a currency conversion in the following situations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Where a Client submits a booking request for a Listing using a Booking Currency that is different from the Listing Country
    Currency, FairlyWed will calculate the Total Fees in the Booking Currency by applying either the Base Exchange Rate or
    the Adjusted Exchange Rate to the Total Fees in the Listing Country Currency at the time of the booking request. Any
    fees that are based on a percentage of the applicable Listing Fees (such as Client Fees), will be calculated based on
    the Listing Fees in the Booking Currency (i.e., after conversion from the Listing Country Currency). The Base Exchange
    Rate will be applied if FairlyWed is unable to process your transaction in the default currency of your Payment Method;
    in all other cases, the Adjusted Exchange Rate will apply.</li>
  <li>When a confirmed booking is modified or cancelled, and a currency conversion has been applied, the Client’s payment will
    be processed using the same Base Exchange Rate or Adjusted Exchange Rate applied at the time of the original booking.</li>
</ul>

<p>13.2 When you as a Client submit a booking request for a Listing, and such request will be subject to a currency conversion,
  you will be able to view the exchange rate applied to do the currency conversion before you checkout.</p>

<h4>22. Applicable Law and Jurisdiction</h4>

<p>If you are contracting with FairlyWed US, these Payments Terms will be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the
  State of Minnesota and the United States of America, without regard to conflict-of-law provisions. Judicial proceedings
  (other than small claims actions) that are excluded from the Arbitration Agreement in Section 23 must be brought in state
  or federal court in Minneapolis, Minnesota, unless we both agree to some other location. You and we both consent to
  venue and personal jurisdiction in San Francisco, California.</p>

<h4>23. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Agreement</h4>

<p>23.1 This Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Agreement shall apply if you (i) are contracting with FairlyWed US; or (ii)
  bring any claim against any FairlyWed entity in the United States (to the extent not in conflict with Section 22).</p>

<p>23.2 <em>Overview of Dispute Resolution Process</em>. FairlyWed is committed to participating in a consumer-friendly dispute
  resolution process. To that end, these Payments Terms provide for a two-part process for individuals to whom Section 23.1
  applies: (1) an informal negotiation directly with FairlyWed’s customer service team, and (2) a binding arbitration administered
  by the American Arbitration Association (“<strong>AAA</strong>”) using its specially designed Consumer Arbitration Rules
  (as modified by this Section 23). Specifically, the process provides:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Claims can be filed with AAA online (<a href="http://www.adr.org/" target="_blank">www.adr.org</a>);</li>
  <li>Arbitrators must be neutral and no party may unilaterally select an arbitrator;</li>
  <li>Arbitrators must disclose any bias, interest in the result of the arbitration, or relationship with any party;</li>
  <li>Parties retain the right to seek relief in small claims court for certain claims, at their option;</li>
  <li>The initial filing fee for the consumer is capped at $200;</li>
  <li>The consumer gets to elect the hearing location and can elect to participate live, by phone, video conference, or, for
    claims under $25,000, by the submission of documents;</li>
  <li>The arbitrator can grant any remedy that the parties could have received in court to resolve the party’s individual claim.</li>
</ul>

<p>23.3 <em>Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution and Notification</em>. Prior to initiating an arbitration, you and FairlyWed
  Payments each agree to notify the other party of the dispute and attempt to negotiate an informal resolution to it first.
  We will contact you at the email address you have provided to us; you can contact FairlyWed’s customer service team by
  <a href="mailto:terms@FairlyWed.com">emailing us</a>. If after a good faith effort to negotiate one of us feels the dispute
  has not and cannot be resolved informally, the party intending to pursue arbitration agrees to notify the other party via
  email prior to initiating the arbitration. In order to initiate arbitration, a claim must be filed with the AAA and the
  written Demand for Arbitration (available at <a href="https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Demand%20for%20Arbitration%20Consumer%20Arbitration%20Rules.pdf"
    target="_blank">www.adr.org</a>) provided to the other party, as specified in the AAA Rules.</p>

<p><strong>23.4 <em>Agreement to Arbitrate</em>. You and FairlyWed mutually agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Payments Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement or interpretation thereof, or to the use of the Payment Services (collectively, “Disputes”) will be settled by binding arbitration (the “Arbitration Agreement”). If there is a dispute about whether this Arbitration Agreement can be enforced or applies to our Dispute, you and FairlyWed agree that the arbitrator will decide that issue.</strong></p>

<p>23.5 <em>Exceptions to Arbitration Agreement</em>. You and FairlyWed each agree that the following claims are exceptions
  to the Arbitration Agreement and will be brought in a judicial proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction: (i) Any
  claim related to actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks,
  trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights; (ii) Any claim seeking emergency injunctive relief based
  on exigent circumstances (e.g., imminent danger or commission of a crime, hacking, cyber-attack).</p>

<p>23.6 <em>Arbitration Rules and Governing Law</em>. This Arbitration Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce
  and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. The arbitration will
  be administered by AAA in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “<strong>AAA Rules</strong>“) then in effect,
  except as modified here. The AAA Rules are available at <a href="http://www.adr.org/" target="_blank">www.adr.org</a> or
  by calling the AAA at 1–800–778–7879.</p>

<p>23.7 <em>Modification to AAA Rules - Arbitration Hearing/Location</em>. In order to make the arbitration most convenient
  to you, FairlyWed agrees that any required arbitration hearing may be conducted, at your option, (a) in the county where
  you reside; (b) in San Francisco County; (c) in any other location to which you and FairlyWed both agree; (d) via phone
  or video conference; or (e) for any claim or counterclaim under $25,000, by solely the submission of documents to the arbitrator.</p>

<p>23.8 <em>Modification of AAA Rules - Attorney’s Fees and Costs</em>. You may be entitled to seek an award of attorney fees
  and expenses if you prevail in arbitration, to the extent provided under applicable law and the AAA rules. Unless the arbitrator
  determines that your claim was frivolous or filed for the purpose of harassment, FairlyWed agrees it will not seek, and
  hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law or the AAA rules, to recover attorneys’ fees and expenses if
  it prevails in arbitration.</p>

<p>23.9 <em>Arbitrator’s Decision</em>. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which
  the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court with proper jurisdiction.
  The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only on an individual basis and only to the extent necessary
  to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim.</p>

<p><strong>23.10 <em>Jury Trial Waiver</em>. You and FairlyWed acknowledge and agree that we are each waiving the right to a trial by jury as to all arbitrable Disputes.</strong></p>

<p><strong>23.11 <em>No Class Actions or Representative Proceedings</em>. You and FairlyWed acknowledge and agree that we are each waiving the right to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action lawsuit, class-wide arbitration, private attorney-general action, or any other representative proceeding as to all Disputes. Further, unless you and FairlyWed both otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one party’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this paragraph is held unenforceable with respect to any Dispute, then the entirety of the Arbitration Agreement will be deemed void with respect to such Dispute.</strong></p>

<p>23.12 <em>Severability</em>. Except as provided in Section 23.11, in the event that any portion of this Arbitration Agreement
  is deemed illegal or unenforceable, such provision shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall
  be given full force and effect.</p>

<p>23.13 <em>Changes</em>. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3 (“Modification of these Payments Terms”), if FairlyWed
  Payments changes this Section 23 (“Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Agreement”) after the date you last accepted these
  Payments Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Payments Terms), you may reject any such change by sending
  us written notice (including by email) within thirty (30) days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in
  the “Last Updated” date above or in the date of FairlyWed’ email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any
  change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and FairlyWed in accordance with the provisions
  of the “Dispute Resolution” section as of the date you last accepted these Payments Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes
  to these Payments Terms).</p>

<p>23.14 <em>Survival</em>. Except as provided in Section 23.12 and subject to Section 20.8, this Section 23 will survive any
  termination of these Payments Terms and will continue to apply even if you stop using the Payment Services or terminate
  your FairlyWed Account.</p>

<h4>
  </a> 24. General Provisions</h4>

<p>24.1 Except as they may be supplemented by additional terms and conditions, policies, guidelines, or standards, these Payments
  Terms constitute the entire Agreement between FairlyWed and you regarding the subject matter hereof, and supersede any
  and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between FairlyWed and you regarding the Payment Services.
</p>

<p>24.2 No joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you or FairlyWed as a result of this
  Agreement or your use of the Payment Services.</p>

<p>24.3 If any provision of these Payments Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision will be struck and will
  not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions.</p>

<p>24.4 FairlyWed’ failure to enforce any right or provision in these Payments Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right
  or provision unless acknowledged and agreed to by us in writing. Except as expressly set forth in these Payments Terms,
  the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Payments Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies
  under these Payments Terms or otherwise permitted under law.</p>

<p>24.5 You may not assign, transfer, or delegate this Agreement and your rights and obligations hereunder without FairlyWed
  Payments’ prior written consent. FairlyWed may without restriction assign, transfer, or delegate this Agreement and any

  Members contracting with FairlyWed UK). Your right to terminate this Agreement at any time remains unaffected.</p>

<p>24.6 This Agreement does not and is not intended to confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than the parties.
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties agree that the payment card networks are third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement
  for purposes of enforcing provisions related to payments, but that their consent or agreement is not necessary for any
  changes or modifications to this Agreement.</p>

<p>24.7 Unless specified otherwise, any notices or other communications permitted or required under this Agreement, will be
  in writing and given by FairlyWed via email, FairlyWed Platform notification, or messaging service (including SMS and WeChat).

<p>The following paragraphs will apply if you are contracting with FairlyWed UK:</p>

<h5>25.1 Payment Service User</h5>

<p>25.1.1 The Payment Services include the payment collection service provided to Vendors contracting with FairlyWed UK. The
  payment collection service constitutes a “payment service” regulated under the Payment Services Regulations and for these
  purposes FairlyWed UK treats Vendors as the “payment service user.”</p>

<p>25.1.2 By agreeing to these Payments Terms you as Vendor have consented to FairlyWed UK’s payment of each Payout to your
  chosen Payout Method. Vendors may change a Payout Method up to one (1) day before the time agreed for the Payout as set
  out in Section 7.2. FairlyWed UK will be deemed to have received the Vendor's payment order to the Vendor on the same date
  FairlyWed UK agrees to initiate the Payout in accordance with Section 7.2.</p>

<p>25.1.3 FairlyWed UK will endeavor to ensure that Vendors based in the EEA will receive each Payout by the end of the business
  day following FairlyWed UK’s initiation of the Payout.</p>

<p>25.2 <em>Communication</em>. FairlyWed will provide the Vendor notice via email when we initiate each Payout. We will also
  provide notice to a Vendor’s registered email address if the Payout is returned to us because of an error. It is your responsibility
  as a Vendor to ensure that you provide us with a current, accurate, and valid email address.</p>

<h5>25.3 Resolution Procedures for Diverted Payouts</h5>

<p>25.3.1 If you as a Vendor believe that a Payout properly due to you has been or may be diverted without your permission (“<strong>Diverted Payout</strong>”)
  because your password or other credentials to log into your FairlyWed Account (“<strong>Credentials</strong>”) are lost
  or stolen, you should notify FairlyWed UK pursuant to Section 26 immediately. As a Vendor you may be liable for losses
  relating to any Diverted Payout arising from the use of lost, stolen, or misappropriated Credentials (including the loss
  of a mobile phone on which you have installed the Application) or where you have failed to keep your Credentials safe,
  up to a maximum of £50. Provided that you notify us of any Diverted Payout without delay and at the very latest within
  13 months of the date of the payment, you may be entitled to a refund of that payment.</p>

<p>25.3.2 We will not be liable for any loss arising from: (i) Diverted Payouts where you acted fraudulently or where, with
  intent or gross negligence, you failed to use the FairlyWed Platform and/or Payment Services in accordance with the FairlyWed
  Terms or these Payments Terms (including the obligation to keep your Credentials safe); (ii) or any payout transaction
  which we facilitated in accordance with information provided by you where the information you provided was incorrect.</p>

<p>25.3.3 If you as Vendor claim not to have received a Payout properly due to you via your chosen Payout Method, FairlyWed
  Payments UK will (if requested) make immediate efforts to trace the payment and will notify you of the outcome. Unless
  we can prove that the payment was received by you via your chosen Payout Method, we will refund the amount.</p>

<p>25.3.4 Any complaints about the Payment Services should be made to FairlyWed UK pursuant to Section 26. Complaints that are
  made in accordance with this section that relate to the provision of Payment Services by FairlyWed UK will be eligible
