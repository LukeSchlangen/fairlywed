<p>These terms and conditions govern FairlyWed’s Guest Refund Policy (the “Guest Refund Policy”) available to Guests who book and pay for an Accommodation listed by a Vendor through the FairlyWed Site or Application (the “Platform&quot;) and suffer a Travel Issue and the obligations of the Vendor associated with the Guest Refund Policy. All capitalized terms shall have the meaning set forth in the <a ui-sref="policies.terms"><em>FairlyWed Terms of Service</em></a> or <a href="/terms/payments_terms"><em>Payments Terms of Service</em></a> unless otherwise defined in this Guest Refund Policy.</p>

<p><strong>1. Travel Issue.</strong> A “Travel Issue” means any one of the following:
(a) the Vendor of the Accommodation (i) cancels a reservation shortly before the scheduled start of the reservation, or (ii) fails to provide the Guest with the reasonable ability to access the Accommodation (e.g., by providing the keys and/or a security code).
(b) the description of the Accommodation in the Listing is materially inaccurate with respect to:
(i) the size of the Accommodation (e.g., number and size of the bedroom, bathroom and/or kitchen or other rooms),
(ii) whether the reservation for the Accommodation is for a private room or shared room, and whether another party, including the Vendor, is staying at the Accommodation during the reservation,
(iii) special amenities or features represented in the Listing are not provided or do not function, such as decks, pools, hot tubs, bathrooms (toilet/shower/bathtub), kitchen (sink/stove/refrigerator or major other appliances), and electrical, heating or air condition systems, or
(iv) the physical location of the Accommodation (proximity).
(c) at the start of the Guest’s reservation, the Accommodation: (i) is not generally clean and sanitary (ii) contains safety or health hazards that would be reasonably expected to adversely affect the Guest’s stay at the Accommodation in FairlyWed’s judgment, (iii) does not contain clean bedding and bathroom towels available for the Guest’s use, or (iv) has vermin or contains pets not disclosed on the Listing.</p>

<p><strong>2. The Guest Refund Policy.</strong> If you are a Guest and suffer a Travel Issue, we agree, at our discretion, to either (i) reimburse you up to the amount paid by you through the Platform, as determined by FairlyWed in our discretion, depending on the nature of the Travel Issue suffered or (ii) use our reasonable efforts to find and book you another Accommodation for any unused nights left in your reservation which in our determination is reasonably comparable to the Accommodation described in your original reservation in terms of size, rooms, features and quality. All determinations of FairlyWed with respect to the Guest Refund Policy, including without limitation the size of any refund, shall be final and binding on the Guests and Vendors.</p>

<p><strong>3. Conditions to Claim a Travel Issue.</strong> Only a Guest may submit a claim for a Travel Issue. If you are a Guest, in order to submit a valid claim for a Travel Issue and receive the benefits with respect to your reservation, you are required to meet each of the following conditions:
(a) you must bring the Travel Issue to our attention in writing (FairlyWed.com/contact) or via telephone and provide us with information (including photographs or other evidence) about the Accommodation and the circumstances of the Travel Issue within 24 hours after the start of your reservation, and must respond to any requests by us for additional information or cooperation on the Travel Issue;
(b) you must not have directly or indirectly caused the Travel Issue (through your action, omission or negligence); and
(c) you must have used reasonable efforts to try to remedy the circumstances of the Travel Issue with the Vendor prior to making a claim for a Travel Issue.</p>

<p><strong>4. Minimum Quality Standards, Vendor Responsibilities and Reimbursement to Guest.</strong> If you are a Vendor, you are responsible for ensuring that the Accommodations you list on the Platform meet minimum quality standards regarding access, adequacy of the description on the Platform, safety, cleanliness, and do not present a Guest with Travel Issues. During the 24-hour period following the Guest’s check-in, Vendors should be available, or make a third-party available, in order to try, in good faith, to resolve Guest issues.
If you are a Vendor, and if (a) FairlyWed determines that a Guest has suffered a Travel Issue related to an Accommodation listed by you and (b) FairlyWed either reimburses that Guest any amount up to the amount paid by the Guest through the Platform for the Accommodation or provides an alternative Accommodation to the Guest, you agree to reimburse FairlyWed up to the amount paid by FairlyWed within 30 days of FairlyWed’s request. All determinations of FairlyWed with respect to the Guest Refund Policy, including without limitation the size of any refund to the Guest, shall be final and binding on the Guests and Vendors. You also agree that in order for you to reimburse FairlyWed up to the amount paid by FairlyWed, FairlyWed may off-set or reduce any amounts owed by FairlyWed to you by this amount. If the Guest remains for part or all of the stay despite the Travel Issue, the Guest will receive a refund that will reduce the amount of the Accommodation Fees ultimately paid to you. If the Guest is relocated to an alternative Accommodation, you may lose part or all of the Accommodation Fee payment for the booking and you may be responsible for reasonable additional costs incurred to relocate the Guest to the alternative Accommodation. 
The rights of the Guests under the Guest Refund Policy supersede the cancellation policy established by a Vendor. If you as a Vendor dispute the Travel Issue you may notify us in writing (FairlyWed.com/contact) or via telephone and provide us with information (including photographs or other evidence) disputing the claims regarding the Travel Issue, provided you must have used reasonable and good faith efforts to try to remedy the Travel Issue with the Guest prior to disputing the Travel Issue claim. You agree that all determinations of FairlyWed with respect to the Travel Issue shall be final and binding on the Guests and Vendors regardless of your submission of a dispute against such Travel Issue. In the event of one or more Travel Issues, FairlyWed, in its discretion, may elect to take additional actions. These actions include, but are not limited to, negatively affecting your Listing ranking, automated reviews indicating Travel Issues, cancelling future bookings, suspending or removing the Listing of the Accommodation or imposing penalties or fees for the administrative burden associated with the Travel Issues.</p>
