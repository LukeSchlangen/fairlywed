<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<p>FairlyWed’s goal is to help couples find, compare, and book their perfect wedding photographer. We are here to make the connection,
    but we want to be clear that we are not your Photographer. The Photographers listed on this site are completely separate
    individuals or businesses.</p>

<h4>Are the Photographers listed here employees of FairlyWed?</h4>

<h4>What is included in the price listed?</h4>
<p>The Photographer agrees to be at the wedding for the number of hours with the number of photographers that are listed in
    the package. The Client will also be given the images and be able to share or print (but not sell) the images.</p>

<h4>May Photographers use their own contracts?</h4>
<p>Yes. Many Photographers require Clients to sign contracts.</p>

<h4>What if the wedding is cancelled, may a Client get a refund?</h4>
<p>Photographers are separate individuals and businesses and may implement their own refund policy. FairlyWed will not initiate
    refunds due to a wedding cancellation by a Client.</p>

<h4>Who is responsible for a Photographer showing up to a wedding?</h4>
<p>The Photographer is responsible for their attendance and performance. The Photographers listed on this site are not employees
    of FairlyWed, but a separate individuals or businesses.</p>

<h4>How much does it cost a Photographer to be listed on FairlyWed?</h4>
<p>It is free to be listed on FairlyWed. FairlyWed makes money when a Client books a Photographer through the site. We take
    10% of a booking’s total price. This 10% includes the credit card fees, so there will not be additional fees for credit
    card processing.</p>

<h4>Who pays the taxes for a booking?</h4>
<p>FairlyWed does not collect taxes for bookings as the services provided do not warrant taxation in all locations. If there
    is a situation where payment of taxes is required, the Photographer is responsible for paying the appropriate taxes.
    For example, if there is an exchange of a tangible item (e.g. a hard drive or flash drive with images from a photographer),
    sales tax may be a requirement. Not every location has sales tax, so as a Photographer, it is your responsibility to
    know the local laws and pay the appropriate taxes.</p>

<h4>Who sets a Photographer’s prices?</h4>
<p>The Photographer. The Photographer can adjust these at any time. The Photographer may also decide which packages to offer
    from the options on FairlyWed.</p>

<h4>Who sets a Photographer’s availability?</h4>
<p>The Photographer. The Photographer can adjust the dates they are available at any time. The one exception is that a day that
    has been booked may not be made available.</p>

<h4>How do Photographers receive money?</h4>

    to create a Stripe account in order to be listed on FairlyWed.</p>
